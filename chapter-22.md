# Chapter 22: Christmas Break Clarity

Christmas break arrived with the usual exodus of students heading home. This time, leaving Cambridge Prep felt different. I packed my duffel bag thinking about Ethan heading to Connecticut, about two weeks without Study Room 3B, about whether we'd text as much as we had over Thanksgiving.

My mother picked me up at the Worcester station with the same warm hug and knowing smile.

"You look happy," she observed as we drove home.

"I got into Princeton."

"I know. You told us. Your father hasn't stopped bragging to everyone at the plant." She glanced at me. "But that's not why you look happy."

I didn't answer, which was answer enough.

Home felt both comforting and strange. My childhood bedroom, the diner shifts, my parents' quiet pride in my acceptance—all familiar. But I kept reaching for my phone, checking for messages from Ethan, counting down the days until we'd be back at school.

On Christmas Eve, my phone buzzed while I was helping my mother make pierogi.

**Ethan:** My father just spent twenty minutes explaining how Princeton's deferral reflects poorly on the Wallace family name.

**Hannah:** That sounds fun.

**Ethan:** I'm hiding in the library. It's the only room in this house where he won't follow me.

**Hannah:** The library in your house.

**Ethan:** It's not as impressive as it sounds. Just a room with books and uncomfortable chairs.

**Hannah:** Still counts as privilege.

**Ethan:** Fair. How's Worcester?

**Hannah:** Making pierogi with my mom. My hands smell like onions and potato.

**Ethan:** That sounds perfect actually.

I smiled at my phone, and my mother noticed. "Ethan?"

"How did you know?"

"You get a specific expression when it's him." She shaped another pierogi with expert hands. "Is he having a hard time with his family?"

"His father is disappointed about the Princeton deferral."

"And you're worried about him."

It wasn't a question. I nodded anyway.

"Hannah." My mother set down her dough. "When I was seventeen, I thought love was supposed to be complicated—dramatic declarations, big gestures, constant uncertainty. But you know what I learned? Real love is simple. It's worrying about someone's Christmas dinner. It's being happy they texted. It's wanting them to succeed even when it might cost you something."

"Mom—"

"I'm not saying you have to do anything about it. I'm just saying don't overcomplicate something that's actually very straightforward." She went back to her pierogi. "You love him. He clearly loves you. Everything else is just logistics."

I stared at the dough in my hands. Everything else is just logistics.

She made it sound so simple.

Maybe it was.

Christmas day was family and food and my uncle's terrible jokes. But that evening, alone in my room, I texted Ethan.

**Hannah:** How was your day?

**Ethan:** Survived. My sister asked again if I have a girlfriend. My mother asked if I'm eating enough. My father didn't ask anything because he's still disappointed.

**Hannah:** I'm sorry.

**Ethan:** It's fine. Standard Wallace family Christmas.

A pause. Then:

**Ethan:** My sister asked who you were.

**Hannah:** What did you tell her?

**Ethan:** That you're my study partner.  That's technically accurate. Reductive, but accurate.

**Hannah:** What would be less reductive?

Another long pause. I watched the typing indicator appear and disappear three times.

**Ethan:** Honest answer?

**Hannah:** Always.

**Ethan:** I'd tell her you're the person who makes Cambridge Prep bearable. Who understands pressure without it having to be explained. Who sees through my bullshit and calls me on it. Who I think about constantly even when we're on break and have no reason to be texting. Who I'm counting down days to see again.

My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it.

**Hannah:** Nine days until we're back.

**Ethan:** I know. I'm counting.

**Hannah:** Me too.

We texted until almost midnight—about nothing and everything. Books we were reading over break, complicated family dynamics, whether Heathcliff deserved redemption in *Wuthering Heights* (he didn't, according to Ethan; he absolutely did, according to me). Normal conversations that felt significant just because they were us, just because I couldn't imagine having them with anyone else.

Finally:

**Ethan:** I should let you sleep. Merry Christmas, Hannah.

**Hannah:** Merry Christmas, Ethan.

I lay in bed staring at my ceiling, thinking about my mother's words. You love him. He clearly loves you. Everything else is just logistics.

The more I thought about it, the more right she seemed.

I loved Ethan. That was simple.

He felt the same way. His texts made that clear, even if neither of us had said it explicitly.

Princeton and Yale, early decision and deferral, academic rivalry and collaboration—those were just circumstances. Logistics to navigate, not insurmountable obstacles.

The week between Christmas and New Year's crawled. I helped at the diner, read ahead for spring semester, revised scholarship essays. But mostly I texted Ethan.

We talked every day. Sometimes about school—the research paper submission, his letter of continued interest, upcoming semester stress. Sometimes about nothing—random observations, inside jokes from Study Room 3B, whether coffee or tea was superior (coffee, obviously, but Ethan inexplicably defended tea).

On New Year's Eve, while my parents watched the ball drop on TV, I was in my room texting.

**Ethan:** New Year's resolution?

**Hannah:** Stop overthinking everything. You?

**Ethan:** Stop pretending I'm fine when I'm not.

**Hannah:** That's a good one.

**Ethan:** Therapist recommended it. Said my anxiety would improve if I was honest about struggling instead of performing effortless success.

**Hannah:** Your therapist is smart.

**Ethan:** She'd like you.

**Hannah:** Yeah?

**Ethan:** You make me do the same thing—be honest instead of performing. It's annoying but effective.

I smiled.

**Hannah:** Happy to annoy you.

**Ethan:** I wouldn't have it any other way.

Downstairs, my parents were counting down to midnight. Ten, nine, eight...

**Ethan:** They're doing the countdown here too.

**Hannah:** Same.

**Ethan:** I wish you were here.

My breath caught.

**Hannah:** I wish I was there too. Or you were here.

**Ethan:** Soon. Eight more days.

The countdown reached zero. Fireworks went off somewhere in the neighborhood. My parents cheered from the living room.

**Ethan:** Happy New Year, Hannah.

**Hannah:** Happy New Year, Ethan.

**Ethan:** This year is going to be better. I can feel it.

**Hannah:** Because of Princeton?

**Ethan:** Because of you.

I stared at that message, reading it over and over. Because of you.

The next morning, I came downstairs to find my mother making coffee. She took one look at my face and smiled.

"You talked to him last night."

"How do you always know?"

"Because you look the way I felt about your father at your age." She poured two cups of coffee. "Terrified and excited and absolutely certain all at once."

I accepted the coffee, warming my hands on the mug. "What if I mess it up?"

"What if you don't?"

"That doesn't help."

"Hannah." She sat down beside me. "You've spent four years at that school proving you deserve to be there. You've earned perfect grades, gotten into Princeton, made yourself invaluable on every club you joined. But you know what I'm proudest of?"

"What?"

"You let yourself care about someone. You let yourself be vulnerable enough to worry about his feelings more than your competition standing. That takes more courage than any academic achievement."

I thought about that as we drank our coffee together. About how loving Ethan had felt like a weakness at first—a distraction from academic goals, a complication I didn't need. But it had made me better. More human. More honest about what actually mattered.

The final week of break passed quickly. Sunday night before we returned to campus, I was packing when Ethan texted.

**Ethan:** Bus tomorrow?

**Hannah:** 2 PM from Worcester.

**Ethan:** Mine gets in around 4. Meet for dinner?

**Hannah:** Study Room 3B at seven?

**Ethan:** Perfect. I've missed it.

**Hannah:** The room or the study sessions?

**Ethan:** Both. But mostly you.

My hands stopped packing. Mostly you.

We were getting dangerously close to saying things we couldn't take back.

Maybe that was okay.

**Hannah:** I've missed you too.

**Ethan:** January is going to be intense. Regular decision deadlines, midterms, waiting for decisions.

**Hannah:** We'll get through it.

**Ethan:** Together?

**Hannah:** Together.

I finished packing with a strange feeling in my chest—part nervousness, part excitement, entirely overwhelming. Two weeks away from Cambridge Prep had given me clarity my mother was right about: this wasn't complicated.

I loved Ethan. He loved me. We made each other better.

January would bring regular decision stress and midterms and the uncertainty of where we'd both end up for college. But none of that changed the simple truth underneath.

I wanted to be with him. Not just as study partners or friends or whatever careful distance we'd been maintaining.

I wanted to tell him I loved him.

And based on his texts, he wanted the same thing.

The question was just when we'd both be brave enough to say it out loud.

Soon, I thought, falling asleep in my childhood bed one last time before heading back to school.

Very soon.
