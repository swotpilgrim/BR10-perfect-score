# Chapter 5: Study Room 3B

I arrive at Wellington Library at 6:55 PM, five minutes early, which means I'm actually on time.

The building is quiet on Friday evening—most students are at the fall mixer in the student union or hanging out in dorms. The library has that hushed, after-hours feeling, with only a handful of dedicated students scattered among the reading rooms.

Study Room 3B is on the second floor, at the end of a hallway lined with bulletin boards advertising study abroad programs and undergraduate research opportunities. The door is closed, lights off. I'm the first one here.

Good. That gives me time to set up.

I unlock the door with the key Dr. Morrison provided, flip on the fluorescent lights, and survey the space. It's small—maybe ten feet by twelve—with one large wooden table that dominates the room, surrounded by six uncomfortable-looking chairs with thin padding. One window overlooking the quad, currently showing only darkness and the faint glow of pathway lights. White walls, institutional carpet, a whiteboard on one wall with mostly-erased equations from whatever study group used the room last.

It feels like a cage.

I unpack my bag methodically. Laptop, power cord, three library books on collaborative research methods (checked out yesterday), two notebooks, pens in four colors, sticky notes, highlighters. I open a new document on my laptop: a typed agenda for tonight's session.

**Session 1 Agenda - October 12**
**7:00-7:15: Introductions and expectations**
**7:15-7:45: Brainstorm research topics (5 minutes individual, 25 minutes discussion)**
**7:45-8:15: Select topic and establish division of labor**
**8:15-8:45: Create project timeline and deliverables**
**8:45-9:00: Schedule next sessions and assign homework**

Thirty minutes' worth of buffer time built in. If we're efficient, we might finish early. If we're not... well, at least we'll have structure.

At 7:03, footsteps echo in the hallway. The door opens and Ethan walks in, wearing jeans and a Harvard sweatshirt—his father's alma mater, I assume—with his tie and blazer presumably left in his dorm. He's carrying one notebook and a pen.

That's it. No laptop, no research materials, no visible preparation.

"You're late," I say before I can stop myself.

Ethan checks his watch. "By three minutes. For a seven o'clock meeting, that's within acceptable margin."

"Acceptable margin is on time."

"Acceptable margin is within five minutes of stated time." He pulls out the chair across from me, sitting down with a casualness that immediately irritates me. "Sorry if my understanding of normal human scheduling doesn't meet your military precision standards."

I bite back a sharp retort. Three minutes into our forced collaboration and we're already at each other's throats. This is going to be a very long six weeks.

"Fine. You're here now." I turn my laptop so he can see the screen. "I've created an agenda for tonight's session. We need to decide on a research topic, establish division of labor, create a timeline, and schedule our remaining sessions. I allocated time for each—"

"Wait." Ethan holds up a hand. "You made an agenda?"

"Of course. We have limited time and specific goals. An agenda ensures we use our time efficiently."

"An agenda that you created. Without asking for my input."

"We're meeting right now. I'm showing you now. That's asking for input."

"No, that's presenting a completed plan and expecting me to follow it." Ethan leans back in his chair. "Which is exactly what Dr. Morrison said you'd do."

My face heats. "I'm trying to be organized."

"You're trying to be in control. There's a difference."

"And you're trying to be difficult for the sake of being difficult."

"I'm trying to make this an actual collaboration instead of you directing and me executing." Ethan's voice is calm but firm. "Dr. Morrison said we need to work as equals. That means equal input from the start. Not you creating an agenda and me following it."

I clench my jaw. He's right, which makes it worse. I did exactly what Dr. Morrison warned about—took charge, organized, planned without partnership.

"Fine," I say tightly. "What's your suggestion?"

"We start by actually talking about what we want to get out of this. Not just completing Dr. Morrison's requirements, but what we each want from a research project. Then we find overlap."

"That's incredibly vague."

"It's called discussion. Normal people do it when collaborating."

"I'm perfectly capable of discussion."

"Then let's discuss. Close the laptop."

I stare at him. "Why?"

"Because you're using it as a shield. Close the laptop, put away the agenda, and let's just talk."

Every instinct screams at me to refuse. The agenda is good. The agenda makes sense. The agenda provides structure that prevents wasted time and meandering conversation.

But Ethan is watching me with a challenge in his eyes, and I refuse to be the one who can't adapt.

I close the laptop.

"Happy?"

"It's a start." Ethan opens his notebook to a blank page. "So. Research topics. What are you actually interested in?"

The question catches me off guard. "For the project?"

"Yes. What would you want to research if this wasn't just a requirement? What's actually interesting to you?"

I hesitate. The honest answer feels too revealing, but we're supposed to be genuine partners, apparently.

"Educational equity," I say finally. "Access to elite institutions for low-income students. The barriers that exist even when students have the academic credentials."

Something shifts in Ethan's expression. "That's personal."

"Most interesting research is."

"Fair point." He writes something in his notebook. "I'm interested in performance pressure. How expectations—internal and external—affect academic achievement and mental health."

Also personal. We both know it.

"Those topics don't overlap," I point out.

"Maybe they do. Educational equity includes pressure on scholarship students to perform perfectly. Performance pressure includes the weight of family legacy expectations. They're different angles on similar themes."

I hadn't thought about it that way. "Pressure and access."

"Or expectations and barriers."

For thirty seconds, we're actually working together, building on each other's ideas. It feels strange. Fragile.

Then Ethan says, "We could research how boarding school culture creates different pressure for different student populations," and I immediately see the flaw.

"That's too broad. We'd need to narrow it significantly or we'll never finish in six weeks."

"I didn't say that was the final topic. I'm brainstorming."

"Brainstorming should be focused or it's just wasting time."

"Brainstorming is supposed to be generative. You narrow later."

"Why narrow later when you can narrow now and save time?"

"Because narrowing too early kills creativity."

We're glaring at each other across the table. The brief moment of actual collaboration has evaporated, replaced by fundamental disagreement about process.

Ethan runs a hand through his hair, frustrated. "Okay. Different approach. What if we each spend this week developing three specific research proposals. Focused, narrow topics that actually interest us. We bring them Monday, present all six, and find common ground."

It's... actually a good idea. And it gets us out of this room before we kill each other.

"Fine," I say.

"Fine," he echoes.

We sit in tense silence for a moment. The fluorescent lights hum overhead. Through the window, I can see students crossing the quad, heading to and from the mixer. Normal Friday night activities. Meanwhile, I'm trapped in Study Room 3B with my rival, unable to agree on anything.

"This isn't working," I say.

"No, it's not."

"We can't even decide how to decide on a topic."

"We have fundamentally different work styles." Ethan taps his pen against his notebook. "You need structure and planning. I need flexibility and space to think."

"Structure isn't bad."

"I didn't say it was. But when your structure becomes rigid control, it shuts down actual collaboration."

"And your flexibility is just lack of preparation."

Ethan's eyes flash. "I'm prepared. I don't need twelve color-coded notebooks and a minute-by-minute agenda to be prepared. I think about things. I process. I come to meetings ready to engage, not ready to direct."

"You came with one notebook."

"And you came with a typed agenda you made without my input. Which is worse for collaboration?"

I don't have a good answer to that.

The silence stretches. I'm acutely aware of time passing—we've been here forty-seven minutes and accomplished nothing except confirming that we can't work together.

"Dr. Morrison is going to ask about our progress," I say finally.

"I know."

"We need something to show her."

"I know that too."

Ethan closes his notebook. "Here's what I think. We're not going to figure out how to collaborate in one session. This is going to be messy and frustrating and we're probably going to argue a lot. But we're also both smart enough to recognize when something isn't working and adjust."

"Your point?"

"My point is that tonight isn't a failure. It's data. We learned what doesn't work—you planning everything, me pushing back, both of us trying to control the process. Monday, we try something different. We each bring proposals, present them without judgment, and find overlap. Equal input from the start."

It's logical. Practical. And it acknowledges that tonight was a disaster without either of us having to admit defeat.

"Okay," I agree.

"Okay."

We pack up in awkward silence. I stack my library books, coil my power cord, close notebooks. Ethan stands, stretches, looks around the small room like he's also feeling its cage-like quality.

"Same time Monday?" he asks.

"Seven PM. Dr. Morrison scheduled all our sessions."

"Right. Mandatory collaboration." There's bitterness in his voice that mirrors my own feelings.

We leave the study room together but split up at the library entrance—Ethan heading toward Thoreau Hall, me toward Whitman. Neither of us says goodnight.

Back in my room, I stare at my planner. Session 1: complete. Seventeen more to go.

I pull up a blank document and start researching. If I'm bringing three proposals Monday, they're going to be thorough, specific, and impossible for Ethan to dismiss.

I'm going to prove I can collaborate.

Even if it kills me.
