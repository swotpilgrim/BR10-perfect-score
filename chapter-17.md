# Chapter 17: Application Season Pressure

Dr. Morrison's voice carried across the senior common room Friday morning. "If you're applying early decision, listen up. November first is two weeks away. That's fourteen days to finalize everything. After that, it's out of your hands until mid-December."

Two weeks. Fourteen days until I submitted my Princeton application and bet my entire future on a single school. Across the room, Ethan met my eyes for half a second.

"I know some of you are stressed," Dr. Morrison continued, "but remember—the application is a snapshot of who you are right now, not a definitive judgment of your worth. Do your best, be honest, and trust the process."

Easy for her to say.

By the time Friday's study session rolled around at seven PM, I'd mentally revised my personal essay seventeen times and convinced myself Princeton was going to reject me for reasons I couldn't even name.

Study Room 3B felt like a refuge when I pushed through the door. Ethan was already there, laptop open, looking equally frazzled. His hair stood up in several directions like he'd been running his hands through it, and there were at least three empty energy drink cans on the table beside him.

"Please tell me you're not as much of a mess as I am right now," he said without preamble.

"I've rewritten my opening paragraph five times today. In my head. During other classes."

"Only five times?" Ethan closed his laptop. "I've mentally revised my entire 'why Princeton' essay so many times the words don't have meaning anymore. It's just a collection of sounds that vaguely resemble English."

I dropped into my usual chair across from him. The November darkness outside made the study room feel insulated from the rest of campus, like we were the only two people in the world obsessing over college applications. "Dr. Morrison said we should do one final review of each other's complete packages tonight. Make sure there are no typos, no inconsistencies, nothing that screams 'reject this applicant immediately.'"

"Reassuring phrasing."

"I'm feeling very reassured right now." I pulled out my own laptop and opened the folder where I'd organized every component of my Princeton application—personal essay, supplemental responses, activity list, additional information. Everything I'd worked toward for four years, distilled into a series of text boxes and PDF uploads. "Do you want to go first, or should I?"

"You go." Ethan reached for the bag of pretzels he'd brought. "I need a minute to mentally prepare for someone actually reading this thing."

I turned my laptop so he could see the screen. Watching him read felt more vulnerable than any of our late-night conversations. Ethan scrolled slowly through each section, silent for almost ten minutes.

"What?" I asked when I couldn't stand the silence anymore. "Is it bad? I knew I should have revised that transition in the third paragraph—"

"Hannah." Ethan looked up from the screen. "This is exceptional."

"You're just saying that."

"I'm really not." He scrolled back to the beginning. "Remember when you first showed me this in October? You were performing the role of 'scholarship student overcoming adversity.' This version is real, honest. It's you." He kept reading. "You included your campus job."

"Dr. Morrison said it shows time management and work ethic." I'd agonized over whether to include it, worried it would highlight how different I was from other applicants.

"It's perfect. Everything about this is perfect—Hannah, you're going to get in."

"You don't know that."

"I know you've earned it. I know admissions committees will see someone brilliant and hardworking who actually cares about learning, not just collecting achievements."

My throat felt tight. "Thank you."

"I'm just being honest." Ethan turned his own laptop around to face me. "Your turn. Be brutal."

I read through his application carefully, seeing the stellar grades and impressive activities I knew he'd have. But then I reached the additional information section, and something was new.

"You disclosed your anxiety disorder," I said.

"You told me I should be direct about it." Ethan's voice was carefully neutral. "That apologizing for struggling made me seem weak, but owning my experience would make me seem human."

"I did say that." I kept reading. He'd written about starting medication sophomore year, about learning to manage panic attacks, about the gap between his polished exterior and his internal reality. It was vulnerable in a way that would have been unthinkable for Ethan Wallace three months ago. "This is brave."

"It's terrifying."

"That too." I finished reading the rest of his application—the essay about Wallace family pressure, the activities list, the "why Princeton" response. When I looked up, I meant every word. "This is really good, Ethan. Genuinely compelling. You're not hiding behind the facade anymore."

"Think they'll accept someone who has panic attacks before calculus exams?"

"I think they'll accept someone who's honest about his struggles and still maintains a 4.0." I pushed his laptop back toward him. "You're going to get in too."

"We can't both get in. Princeton doesn't take multiple students from the same school for early decision. Not usually."

The reality of that statement hung in the air between us. For three years, Ethan and I had been competing for the top spot, for valedictorian, for the best grades. Now we were competing for the same college acceptance, and only one of us was likely to get it.

Except it didn't feel like competition anymore.

"Then Princeton's loss if they only take one of us," I said finally. "Because we're both qualified."

Ethan smiled, and it reached his eyes. "When did we stop wanting to destroy each other?"

"I have no idea. It happened gradually and then all at once." I closed my laptop. "For what it's worth, I'm genuinely rooting for you. Even though we're applying to the same school. Even though theoretically your acceptance might mean my rejection. I want you to get in."

"Same." Ethan leaned back in his chair. "Which is extremely inconvenient, by the way. It would be much simpler if I still hated you."

"So much simpler."

"But also much worse."

"Yeah," I agreed quietly. "Much worse."

We sat in comfortable silence for a moment. Through the window, I could see other students walking across the quad, bundled against the November cold. Normal Friday evening for them—definitely not having existential crises about college applications.

"Professor Brennan stopped me after class today," Ethan said abruptly.

I looked up. "What did he want?"

"To tell me that our collaborative research paper was the best student work he's seen in five years." Ethan pulled a folded piece of paper from his bag and slid it across the table. "He wrote us a note. Asked if we'd be interested in revising it for submission to an academic journal. Said he'd help us with the submission process."

I unfolded the paper and read Professor Brennan's neat handwriting. He'd written half a page about our paper on the Cambridge Prep diplomat's correspondence, praising our analysis and collaborative synthesis. At the bottom, he'd listed two academic journals that published student research.

"We should do it," I said.

"Yeah?"

"Definitely. This is exactly the kind of thing colleges love—genuine intellectual curiosity beyond the classroom." I refolded the note carefully. "Plus, I was proud of that paper. Actually proud, not just 'good grade' proud."

"Because we wrote it together."

"Because we wrote it together," I confirmed. "You made my research better. I made your analysis tighter. The final product was better than anything either of us could have done alone."

Ethan took the note back and tucked it into his bag. "We could mention it in our applications. In the additional information section. That we're working on submitting a paper for publication."

"Dr. Morrison would love that. Demonstrates collaboration and intellectual engagement." I pulled out my phone to check the time—eight-thirty. "We should probably start planning this. Figure out what revisions Brennan wants."

We spent the next twenty minutes discussing the journal submission idea, pulling up the websites for the publications Brennan had suggested, reading through their submission guidelines. It felt natural, planning this project together, assuming we'd continue working as partners.

At nine PM, we packed up our materials and headed out of the library. The temperature had dropped since afternoon, cold enough that I could see my breath in the exterior lights. I'd remembered my heavier coat this time, at least.

"Two more weeks until we submit," Ethan said as we walked across the quad.

"Thirteen days, technically."

"You would know the exact deadline."

"I have a countdown on my phone. Three hundred twelve hours."

We'd reached the fork in the path—Whitman Hall to the left, Thoreau to the right.

"Thank you," Ethan said. "For looking at my application."

"Thank you for doing the same."

"Princeton really would be lucky to have you, Hannah."

"They'd be lucky to have you too."

We stood there for another moment, breath forming clouds in the cold air.

"Same time Monday?" I asked.

"See you Monday, Hannah."

I watched him head toward Thoreau Hall before turning toward my own dorm. Inside, Sarah was painting her nails purple.

"How was studying with your not-rival?" she asked.

"We reviewed each other's Princeton applications."

"And?"

"His is really good. Genuinely compelling. He's going to get in."

Sarah glanced up. "You're rooting for someone competing with you for the same acceptance?"

"Apparently."

"You know what that means, right?"

"That I'm an idiot?"

"That you're falling for him." She looked up, expression softer. "You don't root for your competition unless they've stopped being competition and started being something else."

I sat on my bed. Sarah was right. Six weeks ago, Ethan getting into Princeton while I got rejected would have devastated me. Now, all I'd felt was pride in his honesty and hope.

"When did that happen?" I asked quietly.

"About three weeks ago. You just didn't want to admit it."

I thought about Study Room 3B, about late-night conversations and the way Ethan's face had looked when he told me my application was exceptional. About how much I looked forward to our sessions.

"It's complicated," I said.

"No," Sarah replied. "It's actually pretty simple. You just don't want it to be."

I lay back, thinking about Princeton applications and academic journals and the way Ethan Wallace had transformed from my greatest rival into the person whose success mattered almost as much as my own.

Simple, Sarah had said.

Maybe she was right.
