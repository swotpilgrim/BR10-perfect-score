# BIBLE: The Perfect Score

## Story Premise

Hannah Price and Ethan Wallace have been locked in academic combat for three years at Cambridge Preparatory, one of America's most competitive boarding schools. Hannah, a scholarship student, maintains her perfect 4.0 through relentless discipline. Ethan, naturally gifted but anxiety-ridden, matches her grade for grade. When their college counselor mandates six weeks of joint study sessions to develop collaboration skills crucial for their college applications, both are furious. They're rivals, not partners. But forced proximity in the library's study room reveals the person pushing you hardest might be exactly who understands you best. As competition softens into partnership, Hannah and Ethan discover that the perfect score isn't valedictorian—it's finding someone who makes you want to be better without demanding perfection.

## Protagonist: Hannah Price

**Age:** 17 (senior year)

**Background:** Hannah comes from a working-class family in Worcester, Massachusetts. She attends Cambridge Prep on full academic scholarship, something she's intensely aware of every day. Her parents work multiple jobs to cover what the scholarship doesn't—books, supplies, the occasional weekend trip home. Hannah feels the weight of their sacrifice constantly. She's watched wealthy legacy students glide through with family connections while she's earned every decimal point of her GPA.

**Personality:** Hannah is disciplined, driven, and privately terrified of failure. She maintains rigid schedules, color-coded planners, and backup plans for her backup plans. To classmates, she appears cold and competitive. In reality, she's deeply insecure about deserving her place among students whose families have Ivy League legacies stretching back generations. She's president of Academic Bowl, Debate Team, and Community Service Club—not just for college applications but to prove she belongs. Hannah struggles to relax or show vulnerability, fearing any slip will confirm she's an imposter.

**Goal:** Win valedictorian, secure admission to Princeton (her dream school), and prove she earned her place at Cambridge Prep through merit, not charity.

**Fear/Obstacle:** Deep insecurity that she's not naturally brilliant like her wealthy peers—that her success comes from grinding harder while they succeed effortlessly, making her somehow less worthy.

**Arc:** Hannah learns that perfection is a prison and that letting someone see your struggles doesn't make you weak. She discovers collaboration can be strength, not compromise, and that sharing success with someone who understands the cost makes victory sweeter than achieving it alone.

## Love Interest: Ethan Wallace

**Age:** 17 (senior year)

**Background:** Ethan is a legacy student at Cambridge Prep—his father and grandfather both attended. His family's name is on a library wing. But being a Wallace means expectations Ethan never asked for. His father is a surgeon who believes excellence should look easy. Ethan is genuinely intellectually gifted, but he struggles with severe anxiety that he hides carefully. He takes medication, sees a therapist during school breaks, and has panic attacks in his dorm room that no one knows about. The "effortless genius" reputation is a facade that exhausts him.

**Personality:** Ethan appears confident, charming, and naturally talented. He's captain of the chess club, editor of the literary magazine, and seems to ace tests without studying. In reality, he's drowning in pressure to maintain the Wallace family standards while battling anxiety that makes every achievement feel fragile. He resents the rivalry with Hannah because it's become another thing he can't escape, another measure of his worth. Under the polished exterior, Ethan is thoughtful, kind, and desperately tired of pretending.

**Initial Barrier:** Hannah sees Ethan as the privileged legacy student who has everything handed to him—intelligence, connections, ease. She assumes his success costs him nothing while she sacrifices everything.

**Hidden Depth:** Ethan's "effortless" success requires constant anxiety management, hidden panic attacks, and sleepless nights. His privilege gives him opportunity but not freedom from pressure. He understands the weight of expectations as deeply as Hannah does, just from different angles.

**Arc:** Ethan learns that admitting struggle doesn't diminish achievement and that partnership matters more than individual glory. He stops performing effortless brilliance and lets himself be genuinely seen—anxious, hardworking, and worthy without the facade.

## Supporting Cast

### Dr. Patricia Morrison - College Counselor

Dr. Morrison is in her fifties, Cambridge Prep's head college counselor for fifteen years. She's sharp, no-nonsense, and genuinely invested in her students' growth beyond just college acceptances. She recognizes that Hannah and Ethan are brilliant but emotionally stunted by competition. Their rivalry has made them worse candidates for top colleges that value collaboration and leadership, not just individual achievement. She mandates the joint study sessions not as punishment but as intervention—these two need each other more than they know. Dr. Morrison is firm but compassionate, refusing to back down when both students protest. She writes crucial recommendation letters, giving her leverage. She's the adult who sees beyond grades to the humans trapped in competition.

### Sarah McKenzie - Hannah's Roommate

Sarah is Hannah's roommate and closest friend at Cambridge Prep, though Hannah struggles to fully let her in. Sarah is a day student from a wealthy Providence family, grounded and emotionally intelligent. She's a solid B+ student who doesn't obsess over class rank, which sometimes baffles Hannah. Sarah gently pushes Hannah to relax, drags her to occasional social events, and serves as Hannah's reality check. She's the first to notice when Hannah's rivalry with Ethan starts shifting into something else. Sarah is loyal, funny, and genuinely kind—the friend who reminds Hannah there's more to life than transcripts. She provides comic relief and emotional support, offering perspective when Hannah spirals into perfectionist anxiety.

### Ryan Carter - Ethan's Best Friend and Roommate

Ryan rooms with Ethan and has been his friend since freshman year. He's on the varsity soccer team, academically solid but not obsessed with being top of the class. Ryan knows about Ethan's anxiety because he's witnessed panic attacks Ethan can't hide from a roommate. He's protective and supportive without making Ethan feel fragile. Ryan is the one who tells Ethan the rivalry with Hannah has gotten unhealthy, that winning valedictorian won't fix whatever Ethan's trying to prove. He's easygoing, athletically confident, and provides contrast to Ethan's academic pressure. Ryan also develops a friendly rapport with Sarah, creating a supportive friend group around Hannah and Ethan's evolving dynamic.

### Jennifer Campbell - Academic Rival and Social Antagonist

Jennifer is a legacy student ranked third in the class, perpetually frustrated at being shut out of valedictorian by Hannah and Ethan. She comes from old Connecticut money and resents that a scholarship student (Hannah) is beating her. Jennifer is president of Student Council and uses her social position to make subtle digs at Hannah's background. She's not cartoonishly evil—she's ambitious, insecure about her own worth compared to her successful older siblings, and threatened by Hannah's success. Jennifer spreads rumors when Hannah and Ethan start studying together, suggesting Hannah is manipulating Ethan. She serves as external pressure on their developing relationship and represents the social hierarchies Hannah navigates daily.

### Professor David Brennan - English Department Chair

Professor Brennan teaches AP Literature and has both Hannah and Ethan in his class. He's in his early forties, passionate about literature, and frustrated by students who treat his class as a GPA transaction rather than genuine learning. He recognizes Hannah's analytical brilliance but wishes she'd take intellectual risks instead of playing it safe for the grade. He sees Ethan's natural talent but knows he's coasting on ability without genuine engagement. Brennan becomes an unexpected ally when Hannah and Ethan's joint project impresses him with actual intellectual curiosity instead of grade-grubbing. He represents the adult who values learning over achievement and subtly encourages their partnership.

### Amanda Pierce - Hannah's Academic Bowl Teammate

Amanda is a junior on the Academic Bowl team that Hannah captains. She's enthusiastic, brilliant in history and literature, and idolizes Hannah's work ethic. Amanda represents the students watching Hannah and Ethan's rivalry, seeing them as untouchable academic gods. She's nervous around both of them and provides Hannah glimpses of how intimidating she appears to others. When Hannah starts collaborating with Ethan, Amanda is confused—aren't they enemies? Her perspective helps Hannah see how the rivalry has defined her identity at Cambridge Prep and how changing that dynamic affects her role in the school community.

## Setting: Cambridge Preparatory, Rhode Island

**Time:** Senior year, Fall semester into Winter (September through February), present-day but timeless boarding school atmosphere

**Key Locations:**

- **Wellington Library Study Room 3B**: The private study room where Hannah and Ethan are forced to meet. Small, windowed, with a large wooden table, uncomfortable chairs that promote studying not socializing, and a door that closes for privacy but has a window so it's not inappropriate. This becomes their battleground and eventually their sanctuary—the one place they can drop pretenses.

- **Ashford Dining Hall**: Traditional boarding school dining hall with house tables, assigned seating by grade and dorm. Formal sit-down dinners twice a week in blazers. Hannah eats with scholarship students and Academic Bowl team. Ethan sits with legacy students and chess club. The social geography of the room reflects Cambridge Prep's hierarchies.

- **Hamilton Academic Building**: Where most classes meet, including Professor Brennan's AP Literature. Old brick building with creaky wooden floors, tall windows, and the smell of books and floor polish. Bulletin boards announce National Merit Scholars, college acceptances, academic competition results. The hallways buzz with competitive tension.

- **Residence Halls - Whitman (Girls) and Thoreau (Boys)**: Traditional dorm buildings with shared rooms, common rooms with worn couches, study lounges, pay phones in hallways. Hannah's single room (scholarship perk) in Whitman is small but private. Ethan's double with Ryan in Thoreau overlooks the quad. Dorm life means limited privacy and constant proximity to classmates.

**Period Details:** Cambridge Preparatory was founded in 1889 and maintains traditional New England prep school culture. Uniforms required: blazers, ties for boys, skirts or slacks for girls, Oxford shirts, loafers. The school is co-ed but maintains some separate traditions. Weekly convocation in formal dress. No phones in classes, limited computer lab access. Research requires library time, not Google. Communication happens face-to-face, through notes, or via dorm pay phones. The rhythm follows academic calendar: fall semester crunch before Thanksgiving, midterms in January, college application deadlines creating schoolwide stress.

**Atmosphere:** Cambridge Prep feels like stepping into privilege and pressure combined. The campus is beautiful—ivy-covered brick, manicured lawns, autumn leaves then winter snow—but the competitive atmosphere is suffocating. Students discuss SAT scores, college tours, internships. Class rank is public knowledge. The college counseling office has Ivy League pennants and acceptance statistics posted. It's a pressure cooker where success is expected and failure is visible. But there's also camaraderie in shared struggle, inside jokes among dorm mates, beloved teachers who actually care, and the contained world of boarding school where relationships intensify because you can't escape each other.

## Tone & Voice

First-person POV from Hannah's perspective. Her narrative voice is sharp, self-aware, and occasionally self-deprecating. She's observant about social hierarchies and academic dynamics at Cambridge Prep. Her internal monologue reveals insecurity she'd never show externally—the constant calculation of whether she's good enough, whether she's earned her place. Hannah's voice is sophisticated and intellectually engaged but not pretentious. She uses dry humor as defense mechanism. As the story progresses, her voice softens slightly—less defensive armor, more vulnerability. The tone balances academic pressure with emotional coming-of-age, treating boarding school competition seriously while recognizing the absurdity of teenage achievement obsession. It's Point Romance sophistication: emotionally mature, age-appropriate, focused on internal growth as much as external romance.

## Theme

The perfect score isn't about being valedictorian—it's about learning that partnership doesn't diminish individual achievement. Hannah and Ethan both define themselves through solitary excellence, terrified that needing others makes them weak. Their journey is discovering that the person who challenges you to be better can also be the person who accepts you as you are. True success isn't grades or rank but finding someone who understands the cost of your achievements and values you beyond them. The novel explores how competition can be destructive when it becomes identity, and how collaboration reveals strength you didn't know you had. It's about the pressure of perfectionism, the loneliness of always being "on," and the relief of finally being seen.

## Romance Trope(s)

Academic rivals-to-lovers with forced proximity. Hannah and Ethan are locked in intellectual combat, each seeing the other as obstacle to success. The college counselor's mandate creates forced collaboration—they must work together to get the recommendation letters they need. Proximity breeds understanding: private study sessions reveal vulnerabilities neither shows publicly. The rivalry that defined them becomes the foundation for partnership. They push each other to excel but also give permission to be imperfect. It's the classic "person who challenges you is exactly who you need" romance, set against boarding school pressure cooker where academic stakes feel life-or-death and collaboration becomes intimacy.
