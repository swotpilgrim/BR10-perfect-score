# Chapter 15: The Safe Space

Monday evening, 7:00 PM. Study Room 3B.

The weekend dance feels both recent and distant. Two days ago, I was swaying to music with Ethan's hand on my waist, admitting I didn't want our sessions to end. Now we're back to our usual positions—laptops open, research papers spread across the table, the familiar quiet of academic work.

But something's different. Less careful. More comfortable.

We're finishing Hannah's Columbia supplemental essay. I've been editing for twenty minutes when Ethan interrupts the silence.

"Can I ask you something?"

I look up. "You just did."

"Smartass." He's smiling slightly. "Your family. Do they understand what Cambridge Prep is actually like?"

The question catches me off guard. "What do you mean?"

"You mentioned they're proud of you being here. But do they understand the pressure? The competition? What it takes to maintain perfect grades and work three nights weekly and compete for valedictorian?"

I close my laptop, considering. "They're proud I got accepted. They know I work hard. But understanding the actual intensity?" I shake my head. "My parents didn't go to college. Boarding school culture is completely foreign to them. When I call home and say I'm busy with applications or studying, they think good grades should be enough. They don't grasp that 'good' doesn't exist here—only excellent or failing."

"Do you ever tell them how exhausted you are?"

"No. They sacrificed so much for me to be here. Telling them I'm struggling would make them think the sacrifice wasn't worth it. Or worse, make them worry I can't handle it." I pick at the edge of my notebook. "I protect them from knowing how hard this actually is."

Ethan is quiet for a moment. "I do the same thing. With my father."

"About the anxiety?"

"About all of it. He thinks I'm effortlessly maintaining Wallace family standards. If I told him how much medication and therapy I need just to function, or that I have panic attacks before major exams, or that the Princeton pressure makes me feel like I'm suffocating..." Ethan trails off. "He'd either think I'm weak or blame himself for raising a weak son. Either way, it's better he doesn't know."

"So we both perform for our families."

"Different performances. Same exhaustion."

I lean back in my chair, looking around Study Room 3B. This small, windowless room with its battered table and uncomfortable chairs and half-erased whiteboard. We've spent thirty-six hours here over six weeks. Editing essays, researching Morrison's correspondence, arguing about methodology, admitting fears we don't share with anyone else.

"This is the only place I don't have to perform," I say quietly.

Ethan looks up. "What?"

"Study Room 3B. It's the only place I don't have to be perfect-scholarship-student-Hannah. I can admit I'm tired or worried or struggling, and you don't judge. You just... understand." I meet his eyes. "This room is the only safe space I have."

Something in Ethan's expression shifts. "Same. I don't have to be effortless-Wallace-legacy-Ethan in here. I can be anxious and medicated and uncertain about Princeton, and you still see me as competent."

"You are competent. The anxiety doesn't change that."

"I know. But you're one of maybe three people who actually believe it."

We sit with that truth. Outside this room, we perform our respective roles—scholarship student proving worth through perfect performance, legacy student maintaining family reputation. But inside Study Room 3B, we're just Hannah and Ethan. Exhausted seniors trying to survive impossible pressure.

"Two more weeks," Ethan says. "Then Dr. Morrison's mandate ends."

"I know."

"Do you want it to end?"

The question hangs between us. Honest answer required.

"No," I admit. "These sessions are the best part of my week. Which is terrifying because you're still technically my competition."

"Or we're partners who make each other better."

"Can we be both? Partners and competitors?"

Ethan considers this. "I think we already are. We're both applying to Princeton. We're both ranked first. Competition's real. But we're also helping each other write better essays and manage pressure and remember we're human underneath the achievement metrics. Partnership's real too."

"So when the mandate ends..."

"We keep meeting. If you want."

"I want," I say, perhaps too quickly.

Ethan smiles. "Good. Because I'm not ready to lose this. Whatever this is."

The "whatever this is" feels significant. More than academic partnership. Not quite defined as anything else. But important enough that neither of us wants to lose it.

We return to essay work. Ethan reads my Columbia supplemental aloud, offering suggestions. I listen, making notes. When he finishes, I revise two paragraphs based on his feedback.

"Better?" I ask, turning the laptop so he can see.

"Much better. You're actually answering what Columbia asked instead of just listing achievements."

"That's because you called me out for treating supplements like resume expansions."

"Someone had to."

We work for another hour, comfortable in the focused silence. At eight-thirty, we've finished all pending essay work. Princeton early decisions come in three weeks. All we can do now is wait.

Packing up feels routine now—laptops closed, papers organized, chairs pushed in. We walk out of Study Room 3B together, through the quiet library, into November night.

At the path split, we pause. This has become our ritual. Standing between our separate dorms, neither quite ready to separate.

"Thank you," I say. "For tonight. For asking about my family and understanding the performance thing."

"Thank you for being honest. And for making this room feel safe."

We stand in the cold, looking at each other. Friends? More than friends? Academic partners developing feelings neither of us knows how to name?

All of the above, probably.

"See you Wednesday," Ethan says.

"Seven PM. Archives?"

"Perfect."

He walks toward Thoreau Hall. I head to Whitman.

In my dorm room, Sarah is supposedly studying but actually watching something on her laptop. She pauses when I enter.

"How was the study session?"

"Productive. We finished Columbia supplements."

"Uh-huh." Sarah's expression is knowing. "And?"

"And nothing. We worked on essays."

"Hannah. I'm going to ask you a direct question, and I want an honest answer." Sarah closes her laptop, giving me full attention. "Are you developing feelings for Ethan?"

I should deflect. Maintain my usual privacy about personal matters.

But I'm exhausted from performing, and Sarah's my best friend, and maybe I need to admit this to someone.

"Yes," I say quietly. "I'm developing feelings for Ethan."

"Finally! You admit it!"

"It's complicated. We're competing for valedictorian. We're both applying to Princeton. We're rivals."

"You're also partners who make each other better. You've said so yourself."

"But liking someone I'm competing against is dangerous. What happens if I get into Princeton and he doesn't? Or he gets in and I don't? What happens when they announce valedictorian and only one of us wins?"

Sarah pats the bed next to her. I sit.

"Those are legitimate concerns," she says. "But Hannah, you've been happier these past six weeks than I've seen you in three years. Yes, Ethan's your academic competition. But he's also the person who understands your pressure and exhaustion. He defends you against Jennifer. He makes you laugh. He created a safe space where you don't have to be perfect."

"So what do I do?"

"You let yourself feel what you're feeling. You don't have to act on it right now. But you also don't have to deny it or pretend it's just academic partnership." Sarah squeezes my hand. "Give yourself permission to like him. Even if it's complicated."

I lean my head on her shoulder. "When did you get so wise?"

"I've always been wise. You've been too busy achieving to notice."

We sit like that for a few minutes. My best friend providing comfort without judgment. Another safe space.

Later, after Sarah leaves for her own room, I sit at my desk thinking about Study Room 3B. About Ethan asking about my family and understanding why I perform. About his admission that he performs for his father too. About the way we've created space where imperfection is allowed.

Sarah's right. I am happier. These six weeks of mandated collaboration transformed from punishment to something I look forward to. Monday, Wednesday, Friday evenings are no longer about forced partnership—they're about being seen and understood by someone who gets it.

I like Ethan Wallace.

Not the effortless genius everyone else sees. Not the Wallace legacy or perfect GPA or Princeton-bound golden boy.

Ethan. The person who has anxiety and takes medication and gets nervous about disappointing his father. Who edits my essays with honest critique. Who admitted he didn't want our sessions to end. Who looks at me like I'm more than a scholarship student competition.

Liking him is terrifying.

But denying it would be more exhausting than the performance I'm already maintaining.

So I'll let myself feel it. These complicated, inconvenient feelings for my academic rival and study partner and the one person at Cambridge Prep who actually sees me.

Two more weeks of mandated collaboration.

And then... whatever comes next.

I don't know what that looks like.

But for once, the uncertainty doesn't terrify me.

Maybe because for the first time in three years, I'm not facing it alone.
