# Chapter 2: Effortless Excellence

Professor Brennan's AP Literature classroom is in Hamilton Academic Building's northeast corner, morning light flooding through tall windows. Second day of classes, and I'm already organized: notebook open, pens arranged by color, reading assignment annotated with sticky notes.

Ethan Wallace strolls in thirty seconds before the bell, no visible preparation, and takes a seat three rows behind me.

I don't turn around. I'm aware of him the way you're aware of storm clouds—constant pressure at the edge of my attention.

Professor Brennan is at the board, writing: *"The only way out is through."* —Robert Frost. He's in his early forties, rumpled in the way of teachers who care more about ideas than appearances.

"Welcome to AP Literature. We're starting with *Invisible Man* by Ralph Ellison. Who wants to discuss the prologue?"

My hand goes up immediately, along with three others. Brennan's eyes sweep the room and land on someone behind me.

"Mr. Wallace. What did you make of the narrator's relationship with light?"

"The thousand bulbs in his basement—it's about visibility and power. He's draining electricity from Monopolated Light & Power, taking what society denied him. The excess is defiance."

It's a good answer. Exactly the kind of symbolic analysis Brennan loves.

"And the music? Louis Armstrong?"

"Visibility without being seen. Armstrong's music is everywhere, but the artist himself can be invisible. The narrator identifies with that duality."

I clench my pen tighter. Ethan sounds casual, like the ideas just occurred to him. But I saw him in the library last week. He'd already read the assignment. He's prepared—he just hides it.

Brennan nods. "Good. Miss Price, build on that. How does the narrator's invisibility connect to the boxing match scene?"

I force myself to focus. "The boxing match is spectacle. He's visible as entertainment, as an object, but invisible as a person. The white men watching don't see him—they see what they want to see. A performance."

"Exactly. That tension—being watched but not seen—drives the entire novel." Brennan launches into discussion, writing key terms on the board. I take notes furiously. Behind me, I hear nothing. No pen scratching paper.

Ethan Wallace doesn't take notes. Apparently, he doesn't need to.

By class end, I have three pages of annotations. Ethan closes a notebook that looks barely touched and leaves without hurry.

I hate how easy he makes it look.

The hallway fills with students heading to second period. I'm packing my bag when I hear Jennifer Campbell's voice.

"Did you see last year's acceptances? They're posted by the college counseling office."

I freeze. Every spring, Cambridge Prep posts where seniors got in—a public record of success and failure. It's meant to be inspiring. Mostly it's terrifying.

I shouldn't look, but my feet carry me toward the counseling wing anyway.

Photos of smiling students next to college lists: Accepted, Waitlisted, Attending. Full scholarships highlighted in gold, Ivy League acceptances clustered together.

Stanford. MIT. Harvard. Princeton.

My eyes catch on Princeton: three students accepted, one attending. All had perfect GPAs. All had leadership positions.

"Impressive, isn't it?"

I turn. Ethan is beside me, hands in his pockets, studying the board.

"It's informative," I say.

"Terrifying is the word I'd use. Three accepted out of eight applicants. Not great odds."

"Then we'll have to be better than great."

The corner of his mouth twitches. "Is that what you are, Hannah? Better than great?"

The use of my first name surprises me. We've been rivals for three years, but we don't talk. We exist in parallel, competing without engaging.

"I work hard," I say.

"That's not what I asked."

Before I can respond, Jennifer Campbell appears with two friends. Jennifer is polished in the way of girls who've never questioned belonging—perfectly styled hair, designer watch, confidence like armor.

"Ethan," she says warmly, then cooler: "Hannah."

"Jennifer," we both say.

She gestures to the board. "Inspiring, right? Though I notice the scholarship students who got into top schools all had perfect test scores. No room for error when you're trying to prove you deserve to be here."

The comment lands like a slap. Subtle enough to deny, pointed enough that everyone hears the implication.

My face heats. I should say something cutting, something that puts Jennifer in her place, but my throat tightens and the words won't come.

"Interesting observation," Ethan says, tone cooling. "Though I'd argue the real pressure is on legacy students. We're expected to maintain family standards from day one. Much easier to fail when everyone's watching you live up to your last name."

Jennifer blinks. "I didn't mean—"

"And for the record, Hannah's earned everything she's achieved here. Unlike some of us who got in because our grandparents' names are on buildings."

Silence. Jennifer's face flushes. Her friends study the floor.

Then Ethan walks away, leaving me trying to process what just happened.

He defended me. Ethan Wallace—my rival—just defended me against Jennifer's casual cruelty.

I don't know what to do with that.

Jennifer recovers quickly. "How nice that Ethan's feeling charitable. Good luck this year, Hannah. You'll need it."

She sweeps away. I'm left staring at the board, mind spinning.

Why would Ethan defend me? Unless... unless he was defending himself too. Legacy pressure. Family expectations.

Maybe his perfect life isn't as effortless as it looks.

I shouldn't go to Academic Decathlon practice. It's not my club. But fourth period is free study, and the practice room is across from the library, and I tell myself I'm just curious.

I'm absolutely not seeking information about Ethan Wallace.

Through the window, I see fifteen students in a semi-circle. Ethan stands at the front with flashcards. Captain—of course. Captain of Academic Decathlon, editor of the literary magazine, president of chess club. He collects leadership positions like stamps.

I hover in the hallway, watching through the window.

"Next question: In economics, what is the cost of the next best alternative foregone?" Ethan's voice is muffled but audible. This is performance, not passion.

"Opportunity cost," someone answers.

"Correct. Which Roman emperor divided the empire into East and West?"

"Diocletian."

"Yes. Next—"

Twenty minutes of this. Ethan asks questions, students answer, he nods and moves on. Efficient. Mechanical.

No energy. No enthusiasm. He's going through motions. A girl in front glances at her friend with concern. A boy near the back is on his phone.

Ryan Carter sits in the back corner, watching Ethan with something like worry. When Ethan stumbles over a question—mixing up Treaty of Versailles dates—Ryan straightens, alert.

"Let's take five," Ethan says abruptly.

Students scatter. Ryan crosses to Ethan, says something quiet. Ethan shakes his head, waving him off.

I should leave. This is weird. But I'm caught by the disconnect. In class this morning, he was sharp, brilliant. Here, he's hollow.

Ethan rubs his eyes, shoulders tight. Ryan says something else. Ethan snaps a response that makes Ryan step back, hands raised.

Then Ethan realizes. His shoulders drop. He says something—apology, probably—and Ryan claps his shoulder. Easy forgiveness.

Thirty seconds, but it reveals more than three years of observation. Whatever excellence he projects, it costs him.

I slip away before practice resumes, but the image stays with me: Ethan Wallace, who makes everything look easy, looking absolutely exhausted.

That evening, walking back from the library at nine, I take the path between Whitman and Thoreau Halls. The long way, but the night is cool and I need to walk.

That's my excuse.

Thoreau Hall's windows glow gold against brick. I can see into rooms—students at desks, a group gaming, someone doing pull-ups. The casual intimacy of dorm life.

Third floor, corner room. Ryan's room. Which means Ethan's too.

The window is open. Inside, Ethan sits at his desk, head in his hands. Blazer off, tie loosened, polish gone. He looks like someone running on empty.

He stands abruptly, pacing. Three steps to the window, three steps back. His hands shake as he runs them through his hair. Tension in every line.

This is not effortless excellence. This is someone barely holding together.

Ryan enters, saying something. Ethan waves him away. Ryan doesn't leave. He sits on his bed, waiting. Just present, not pushing.

Sarah does that for me sometimes, when I'm spiraling but won't talk.

Ethan sinks into his chair, head dropping forward. Utterly defeated.

I should go. This is private. But I can't stop trying to reconcile this Ethan with the one who dominated discussion this morning, who defended me in the hallway, who runs clubs with apparent ease.

What's he hiding? Why?

"Hannah?"

I jump. Sarah stands behind me, laptop bag in hand, looking amused.

"Studying the architecture?"

"I was just walking back from the library."

"And stopped to stare at Thoreau Hall because...?"

"I wasn't staring."

Sarah glances at the window, then at me. "If you're going to obsess over your rival, at least be subtle."

"I'm not obsessing. I'm observing."

"You're stalking."

"We're on a public path. His window is open."

Sarah links her arm through mine, steering me toward Whitman. "Come on, stalker. You need sleep."

I let her pull me away, but I glance back once. Ethan is still at his desk, the weight of the world crushing him.

All this time, I thought he had it easy. Legacy student, family connections, natural brilliance.

But maybe Ethan Wallace works just as hard as I do.

He just hides it better.
