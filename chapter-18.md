# Chapter 18: The Last Mandated Session

Monday evening found me walking toward Wellington Library with nervousness in my chest. Which made no sense. I'd been meeting Ethan three times a week for six weeks now. Eighteen sessions total—the last mandated one.

When had Ethan Wallace stopped being my rival and started being the person I most looked forward to seeing?

The library was quiet. I climbed to the second floor and pushed open the door to Study Room 3B.

Ethan was already there, laptop open, staring at the wall.

"Hey," I said, dropping my bag on the table.

"Hey." He focused on me, and something in his expression made my stomach do a complicated flip. "So. Session eighteen."

"The last mandated one." I sat down across from him. "Dr. Morrison said she'd check in tonight."

"I think we've managed not to kill each other."

"Mostly."

Ethan smiled. "There was that one time you threatened to throw your AP Lit anthology at my head."

"You deserved it. You were being deliberately obtuse about *Wuthering Heights*."

"Heathcliff is just a terrible person, not a complex romantic hero."

"You're missing the entire point of the novel."

We grinned at each other, and the nervousness shifted into something warmer. Familiar territory—academic arguments that weren't really arguments anymore.

The door opened and Dr. Morrison stepped inside, clipboard in hand. She looked between Ethan and me with an expression I couldn't quite read.

"Good evening, you two."

"Dr. Morrison," we said in unison, which made her smile.

She sat down at the head of the table, creating an awkward triangle between the three of us. "So. Six weeks of mandatory collaboration. How did it go?"

Ethan and I exchanged a glance. I gestured for him to answer first.

"It went well," he said carefully. "Better than expected, honestly."

"Hannah?"

"I agree. The research paper turned out really well. Professor Brennan wants us to submit it to an academic journal." I paused. "And the application essay work helped both of us, I think."

"I know it did. I read your revised essays." Dr. Morrison made a note on her clipboard. "They're both significantly improved from your first drafts. More honest, more vulnerable. That's what Princeton is looking for—not just stellar grades but actual human beings."

The mention of Princeton made something twist in my stomach. Two weeks until early decision deadline. Fourteen days until Ethan and I both submitted applications to the same school, competing for the same limited spots.

"More importantly," Dr. Morrison continued, "you've demonstrated genuine collaboration. Your research paper showed real synthesis—actual intellectual partnership. That's what I wanted to see."

"So the mandate worked?" Ethan asked.

"The mandate worked." Dr. Morrison stood. "As of tonight, you're released from the requirement. If you want to continue meeting, that's your choice. No pressure either way."

She left, closing the door with a soft click.

Ethan and I sat in silence. The study room suddenly felt different—a space we'd have to actively choose to return to. For six weeks, Monday-Wednesday-Friday at seven PM had been non-negotiable. Now it was optional.

"So," Ethan said finally.

"So," I echoed.

"Do you want to keep meeting?"

The answer was obvious—yes, I'd been looking forward to these sessions more than anything else in my schedule. But saying that felt like admitting something I wasn't ready to examine.

"Do you?" I countered.

"I asked you first."

"That's not how this works. We make decisions together now, right? That's what Dr. Morrison taught us."

"Fair point." Ethan pulled his laptop toward him. "I'd like to keep meeting. The journal submission will take work. And I have scholarship applications and Yale supplements that could use another pair of eyes."

All practical reasons. None acknowledging the real question between us.

"I have scholarship applications too," I said. "And I promised to help with your deferral strategy if Princeton doesn't accept you early decision."

"When Princeton doesn't accept me early decision," Ethan corrected. "Let's be realistic about the odds."

"You don't know that."

"Hannah, we both applied to the same school. They're not taking both of us. Your application is stronger—scholarship student working dining hall job while maintaining perfect GPA. I'm just another legacy kid who finally got honest about anxiety."

"Stop." I closed my laptop. "Your honesty makes you human. That's what they want to see."

"You're sweet to say that."

"I'm being accurate." I met his eyes. "I'm going to be devastated if you don't get in, because you deserve it as much as I do."

Ethan's expression shifted to something vulnerable. "I'll be devastated if you don't get in. Which is inconvenient, because theoretically your rejection would increase my odds."

"Theoretically."

"But I don't care about my odds anymore. Not if they depend on you failing."

We sat with that admission. Through the window, lights came on across campus as evening settled into night.

"So we keep meeting," I said. It wasn't a question.

"We keep meeting," Ethan confirmed. "Monday, Wednesday, Friday?"

"Same schedule?"

"Same schedule. Seven to nine PM, Study Room 3B if it's available, somewhere else if it's not."

"No pressure, though. If one of us needs to skip a session, that's okay."

"Agreed. Optional, not mandatory."

We'd negotiated the terms like we were drafting a contract, which should have felt clinical. Instead it felt important, like we were building something that mattered enough to deserve clear parameters.

"What should we work on tonight?" Ethan asked. "Since we're already here."

I checked my planner. "I have scholarship essays for three different foundations. They're all variations on 'why I deserve money for college,' which is getting repetitive."

"I can help with that. Scholarship essays are basically personal statements with a financial angle."

"What about you?"

"Homework for AP Lit. Essay on whether Heathcliff is a romantic hero or just a terrible person."

I laughed. "You're going to argue he's terrible."

"Obviously. Because he is."

"Professor Brennan is going to eviscerate you."

"Brennan appreciates a well-argued contrarian position."

"Brennan appreciates when students actually understand the text before arguing with it."

"I understand the text. I just think the text is wrong about Heathcliff being sympathetic."

We fell into the familiar rhythm of our study sessions—working in companionable silence, occasionally asking questions or reading passages aloud, trading snacks from Ethan's seemingly endless supply of vending machine purchases. At nine PM, we packed up our materials with the same efficient routine we'd developed over eighteen sessions.

Outside, the November cold had sharpened into something that felt more like December. My breath formed clouds in the air as we walked across the quad.

"Thanksgiving break next week," Ethan said.

"Five days without study sessions."

"Are you going home to Worcester?"

"Yeah. My parents expect me for Thanksgiving dinner. Help out at the diner over the weekend." I pulled my coat tighter against the wind. "You?"

"Connecticut. Family estate. My father interrogating me about Princeton prospects and whether I've scheduled my alumni interview yet."

"That sounds fun."

"It's going to be terrible." Ethan shoved his hands in his pockets. "But it's only five days. Then we're back here and back to normal."

Normal. As if there was anything normal about what we'd built over the past six weeks. As if Study Room 3B had always been our sanctuary and not our battleground. As if Ethan Wallace had always been the person I most wanted to talk to instead of the person I most wanted to beat.

We'd reached the fork in the path—Whitman Hall to the left, Thoreau to the right.

"Five days," I said.

"We'll survive."

"Will we, though?"

Ethan smiled. "Probably not. But we can text if it gets really bad. Academic emergencies only."

"Define academic emergency."

"When you can't decide whether a comma should be a semicolon."

"That's always an emergency."

"Exactly."

We stood there for another moment, neither moving toward our respective dorms. The campus was quiet around us, most students already inside against the cold. Above us, stars were visible despite the security lights—sharp and cold and distant.

"I'll miss this," Ethan said abruptly. "Over break, I mean. These sessions."

My chest felt tight. "Me too."

"It's strange, right? Six weeks ago, I would have been thrilled to have a break from mandatory time with you."

"Six weeks ago, I was plotting ways to make Dr. Morrison rescind the requirement."

"And now?"

"Now I'm already looking forward to next Monday." The admission came out quieter than I'd intended.

Ethan's expression softened. "Me too, Hannah. Me too."

He headed toward Thoreau Hall, and I turned toward Whitman, my thoughts spinning. Inside, Sarah was studying for her own finals, textbooks spread across her bed in organized chaos.

"How was the last mandated session?" she asked without looking up.

"It wasn't the last session. Just the last mandated one."

"So you're keeping meeting?"

"Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Same schedule, but optional now."

Sarah finally looked up, eyebrow raised. "You're voluntarily spending six hours a week studying with Ethan Wallace."

"We have work to do. The journal submission, scholarship essays, his Yale supplements—"

"Hannah."

I sat on my own bed, pulling my knees to my chest. "What?"

"You know what."

I did know. I'd known since Friday when I'd read his Princeton application and felt proud instead of competitive. I'd known since he'd told me I belonged at Cambridge Prep with conviction that made me believe it. I'd known since I'd started looking forward to our sessions more than anything else in my schedule.

"It's complicated," I said.

"You keep saying that."

"Because it keeps being true."

Sarah shook her head, smiling. "No. It's actually really simple. You like him. He clearly likes you. The only complicated part is that you're both too stubborn to admit it."

I lay back on my bed, staring at the ceiling. Thanksgiving break started Wednesday. Five days at home in Worcester, helping at the diner, eating too much turkey, listening to my parents ask about school. Five days without Study Room 3B and late-night walks across the quad and Ethan's terrible opinions about Heathcliff.

The mandate was over. We were choosing this now—choosing to keep meeting, choosing to support each other's applications even though we were competing for the same acceptance, choosing partnership over rivalry.

Dr. Morrison had been right. The forced collaboration had worked.

But what we'd built felt like more than just successful teamwork.

And I had five days of Thanksgiving break to figure out whether I was brave enough to admit it.
