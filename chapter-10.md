# Chapter 10: The First Real Conversation

Friday evening, 7:00 PM. Four weeks into Dr. Morrison's mandate—two-thirds through required collaboration.

I arrive at Study Room 3B to find Dr. Morrison waiting. My stomach drops.

"Hannah. Perfect timing." She's holding a folder. "Ethan should be here any moment."

He walks in at 7:02, stopping when he sees her.

"Dr. Morrison. We weren't expecting—"

"A progress check. Sit." She gestures to the table. We sit, exchanging wary glances. "Show me your research project."

I pull up our merged document, turning my laptop so she can read. Dr. Morrison scrolls through slowly. We wait in tense silence.

After five minutes, she looks up. "This is excellent work."

Relief floods through me.

"The integration is sophisticated. Clear, well-argued, rigorous." She looks between us. "You couldn't have produced this individually. It's genuinely collaborative."

"Thank you," I say.

"But has this collaboration extended beyond research?" Dr. Morrison closes my laptop. "Have you worked on each other's college essays?"

Ethan and I exchange glances. We've put off the more vulnerable essay feedback.

"Not yet," Ethan admits.

"Then that's your assignment for the next two weeks. Bring your Princeton essays and help each other improve them. Really improve them, not just proofread." Dr. Morrison stands. "I want genuine investment in each other's success. That's the collaboration that matters."

She leaves us alone with the new assignment.

"Princeton essays," I say.

"The most personal essays we'll write." Ethan runs a hand through his hair. "Great."

We sit in silence. The research project was safer—analyzing a historical figure instead of exposing ourselves. But essays reveal who we actually are beneath achievements.

"We could put this off," Ethan says. "Work on our research conclusion."

"We should start. Get it over with." I pull out my laptop, hands shaking slightly.

Ethan watches me. "You're terrified."

"I'm not—" I stop. We've spent four weeks being honest about academic work. Time to be honest about this. "Yes. My Princeton essay is about being a scholarship student. Worth and effort. It's the most vulnerable thing I've written."

"Mine's about anxiety," Ethan says quietly. "Performance pressure, panic attacks, the gap between who people think I am and who I actually am. So yeah. Also terrified."

We look at each other. Two people who've hidden behind perfect facades for three years, about to show each other what's underneath.

"Equal trade?" I suggest. "We read in silence first?"

"Deal."

We email each other our essays. I open Ethan's, he opens mine. Twenty minutes of quiet breathing and occasional chair shifts.

Ethan's essay is titled "The Wallace Standard." Third generation Wallace at Cambridge Prep, carrying a family name that opens doors but sets impossible expectations. His first panic attack sophomore year—during a chemistry exam he knew he'd ace. Anxiety not about failure but about the exhausting performance of effortless success.

He writes about his therapist, medication, panic attacks he hides from his father. Being literary magazine editor while having panic attacks before deadlines. Chess club president with trembling hands he disguises by gripping pieces too tight.

Raw. Honest. Vulnerable.

Almost perfect.

I finish and look up. Ethan is still reading mine.

My essay: "The Price of Perfect." Arriving at Cambridge Prep at fourteen, the only scholarship student in my dorm. Parents working multiple jobs. Busing tables three nights weekly. Color-coded planners not as quirks but survival mechanisms—I can't afford wasted time or B+ grades.

Imposter syndrome. Feeling like a fraud among students who belong by birthright. Fear that one mistake will prove everyone right.

The most honest I've been about what it costs to never fail.

Ethan finishes. Sets down his phone. Looks at me with recognition.

"Your essay is incredible," he says.

"So is yours."

"But they're not done. Neither is." Ethan pulls my laptop toward him. "You're doing the research paper thing—presenting facts without interpreting. Here, where you describe busing tables. You say 'I work three nights weekly to earn money for supplies.' Factual. But what does that feel like? Serving classmates who have trust funds?"

The question hits hard. "Humiliating. Visible and invisible simultaneously. They see me clearing plates but not as their equal."

"Write that. That's the real essay." He scrolls down. "And here, about your parents. You write 'They work multiple jobs.' Tell us what that means. What jobs? What are they giving up?"

I hesitate. Too personal.

"My dad works construction and drives ride-share at night. My mom cleans houses and does bookkeeping on weekends. They're exhausted constantly. They never complain, but I see it. They're doing this for me, so I can maybe break our family's cycle of never-quite-enough." The words spill out. "And if I fail, their sacrifices mean nothing."

"That," Ethan says softly. "Write exactly that. The fear, the responsibility, the weight. That's what makes you different—not your GPA but your understanding of what perfection costs."

He's right. I hate that he's right because it means more vulnerability.

"Your turn," I say, pulling his laptop toward me. "You're hiding behind clinical language. 'I experience anxiety that manifests in physical symptoms including elevated heart rate and tremors.' Medical description. Tell us what a panic attack actually feels like."

Ethan's jaw tightens. "Why does that matter?"

"Because you're presenting anxiety as a challenge you've overcome. But that's not honest. Anxiety isn't past tense. It's present, ongoing. You're managing it, not conquering it."

"Admitting ongoing struggle doesn't make me look strong."

"Admitting ongoing struggle while achieving everything you have makes you remarkable." I highlight a paragraph. "Here, chess club president. You say 'I've learned to manage symptoms despite challenges.' Rewrite honestly. What does managing symptoms look like? Medication, breathing exercises, excusing yourself before a panic attack in front of your team?"

Ethan is quiet. "You want me to write about sitting in bathroom stalls during tournaments, trying to stop shaking long enough to go back and play like nothing's wrong?"

"Yes. That's real. That's what Princeton needs—not effortless genius but someone who achieves despite genuine struggle."

"That makes me sound broken."

"That makes you sound human." I meet his eyes. "You chose to write about anxiety. Don't back away by making it clinical and conquered."

We stare at each other. This isn't about grammar anymore. This is about trust.

"If I write that honestly—the panic attacks, the medication, the exhaustion of performing—do you think it makes me look weak?" Ethan asks.

"I think it makes you look brave. And self-aware. And like someone who understands that worth isn't about perfection."

Ethan exhales slowly. "Okay. I'll rewrite it. More honestly."

"I'll do the same. Make mine actually about feelings instead of just facts."

For the next hour, we work on our essays. Not together—these are still our individual stories—but side by side, occasionally asking each other questions.

"Does this sound too bitter when I write about serving classmates dinner?"

"No. It sounds honest. But add something about why you keep doing it. Otherwise it's just resentment."

"Is this too vulnerable when I describe the panic attack before the publication deadline?"

"Maybe tone down the physical details slightly, but keep the emotional impact. The fear of failing in front of everyone is the important part."

By nine o'clock, both essays are significantly revised. More honest, more vulnerable, more real.

"I need to think about this before I submit it," Ethan says, saving his document. "This version is... a lot."

"Same. It's one thing to write vulnerability. It's another to send it to Princeton admissions."

We pack up in contemplative silence. The session tonight was different from research collaboration. More personal. More risky.

At the library entrance, Ethan pauses. "Can I ask you something?"

"You just did."

He gives a small smile. "Does writing about being a scholarship student—about the financial pressure and feeling like you don't belong—does that feel like exposing weakness?"

"Every day," I admit. "But I guess the essay is about owning that instead of hiding it. Saying yes, I'm here on scholarship, yes I work three nights a week, yes I'm terrified of failing—and I'm achieving anyway."

"Yeah," Ethan says. "That's what I'm trying to do with the anxiety. Own it instead of hiding it."

"We're both pretty good at hiding things."

"Three years of practice." Ethan shifts his bag on his shoulder. "But maybe being honest is harder and braver than being perfect."

"Dr. Morrison would approve of that sentiment."

"Dr. Morrison is annoyingly right about most things."

We walk toward our separate dorms. At the path split, we pause longer than usual.

"Thanks for pushing me on the essay," Ethan says. "The honest version is better even if it's scarier."

"Thanks for doing the same. My essay needed the emotional truth, not just the facts."

"See you Monday?"

"Yeah. See you Monday."

I watch him walk away, then head to Whitman Hall. In my room, I reopen my revised Princeton essay. It's more vulnerable than anything I've ever written. More honest about fear and pressure and the weight of being the scholarship student who can't afford to fail.

It's also better. Truer. More me.

Ethan was right—being honest is harder and braver than being perfect.

And maybe that's what Princeton actually wants to see.

Not perfect students. But real ones.
