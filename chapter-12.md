# Chapter 12: The Scholarship Student

Wednesday evening. Five weeks into collaboration. One week remaining in Dr. Morrison's mandate.

I'm running late—my dining hall shift went long because someone called in sick and I covered extra tables—and I sprint across campus to Study Room 3B at 7:08.

Ethan is already there, working on his laptop. He looks up when I burst through the door, slightly out of breath.

"Sorry. Shift ran late. Someone was sick—"

"It's fine. I figured." Ethan closes his laptop. "You need a minute?"

I drop into my chair, catching my breath. My feet ache from two hours of carrying trays and my hands smell like industrial dish soap despite washing them. This is not how I prefer to show up to study sessions—exhausted and rushed and smelling like dining hall grease.

"I'm fine. What are we working on tonight?"

"Actually, I have a question first." Ethan leans back. "Your dining hall schedule. You work Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, right?"

"Six to nine. Three nights weekly." I pull out my laptop, ready to move past this. "So—essays?"

"How much do you make? From busing tables?"

The question stops me cold. "Why?"

"Just curious. You mentioned it in your essay—working for supplies and fees. I'm trying to understand the actual economics."

"Why do you need to understand the economics?"

"Because you write about financial pressure in your essay and I want to make sure you're describing it accurately. As your essay editor."

It's a reasonable explanation. But it feels invasive, like he's asking me to quantify my family's precarity in dollars and cents.

"I make minimum wage plus occasional tips," I say stiffly. "Roughly forty dollars a week after taxes. More during formal dinners when parents visit and tip. It adds up to about $1,500 per year."

"And that covers your expenses?"

"Some of them. Books are about $800 yearly. Application fees were $320 total. SAT subject tests another $100. The scholarship covers tuition and room, but not everything else."

Ethan is quiet, processing. I hate this—laying out my family's finances for someone whose trust fund probably earns more in interest monthly than I make all year.

"I'm sorry," he says finally. "I didn't realize how much you were actually managing on your own."

"Why would you? It's not your concern."

"It is now. We're—" He stops. "We're working together. What affects you affects our collaboration."

"This doesn't affect our collaboration. I've been managing fine for three years."

"Fine? Hannah, you work fifteen hours weekly on top of classes, clubs, and maintaining a perfect GPA. That's not fine, that's unsustainable."

"It's necessary."

"It shouldn't be."

"But it is." I snap my laptop open. "Can we please work on essays now instead of dissecting my financial situation?"

Ethan raises his hands in surrender. "Okay. Columbia supplementals?"

We work in tense silence for twenty minutes, but I can feel Ethan's attention drifting. He keeps looking at me instead of his screen, clearly wanting to say something.

"What?" I finally ask.

"Nothing."

"You're staring."

"I'm thinking."

"Think quieter."

Ethan laughs despite the tension. "You know what your problem is?"

"I have many problems. Which specific one?"

"You don't let people help you."

The observation stings because it's accurate. "I don't need help."

"Everyone needs help. But you've convinced yourself that needing help means weakness or failure or proving everyone right who thinks scholarship students don't belong."

"That's not—" I stop. Because it is. It's exactly right. "I can't afford to need help. If I need help, it means I can't handle this on my own, which means maybe I don't deserve to be here."

"That's ridiculous."

"It's reality. Legacy students get help all the time—tutors, family connections, financial cushions. Nobody questions whether you deserve help. But if I need it? That confirms I'm the charity case who got in on luck instead of merit."

Ethan frowns. "You got in on merit. You maintain your place on merit. Needing help with finances or workload doesn't change that."

"Tell that to Jennifer Campbell. Or anyone who thinks scholarship students are taking spots from more deserving applicants."

"Jennifer Campbell is threatened by you because you're better than she is despite working twice as hard. Her opinion is irrelevant."

"Her opinion represents what a lot of people think."

"Then a lot of people are wrong."

We sit in silence. I can feel my defenses weakening, the exhaustion of three years maintaining perfect facades finally cracking through.

"I'm tired," I admit quietly. "I'm so tired of working this hard and pretending it's fine. I'm tired of calculating every dollar and scheduling every fifteen minutes and never having room for error. I'm tired of being invisible to half the school and resented by the other half. And I'm tired of not being allowed to complain because at least I have the scholarship, at least I'm here, at least I have the opportunity."

Ethan is very still, listening.

"My parents sacrificed everything to support me being here. They're exhausted and I know it. And I can't fail them. I can't waste their sacrifices by not being perfect." My voice cracks slightly. "But perfect is so exhausting. And I can't tell them that because they'll worry or think it's not worth it. So I just keep going. Keep working, keep achieving, keep pretending I'm fine."

"You don't have to pretend with me," Ethan says quietly. "Not anymore."

I look up, surprised by the gentleness in his voice.

"I know what it's like to pretend everything's fine when you're drowning," he continues. "Different pressures, same exhaustion. And you're right—I can't fully understand what it's like to worry about application fees or work three nights weekly. But I do understand the weight of expectations you can't escape and the loneliness of maintaining a facade no one's allowed to see through."

"So what do we do? Keep pretending?"

"Or we stop. At least with each other." Ethan closes his laptop. "You don't have to be perfect-Hannah with me. You can be exhausted-Hannah who's working too hard and worried about money and tired of performing. That's okay."

"And you can be anxious-Ethan instead of effortless genius."

"Deal."

It's a strange pact. Permission to be imperfect with each other. To admit struggle without judgment.

"I'm still not taking charity," I say. "If you're thinking about offering money or—"

"I wasn't," Ethan interrupts. "But I was thinking we could split research tasks differently. I take more of the conclusion writing for our project since you're swamped with work schedule. Equal contribution but distributed according to actual availability."

It's practical, not charitable. I can accept that.

"Okay. That works."

"And maybe you let Sarah drag you to one social event before semester ends. Just one. To prove you're capable of not working for two hours."

"That sounds terrible."

"Probably. But you might actually be seventeen for an evening instead of a scholarship-student-achievement machine."

I laugh despite myself. "Fine. One social event. If Sarah can convince me."

"She will. She's terrifyingly persistent."

We return to work, but the atmosphere has shifted. Less tense. More honest.

Around eight-thirty, Ethan asks, "When's your next shift?"

"Friday."

"And after that?"

"After my shift? I usually do SAT prep or essay work until eleven."

"That's ridiculous. You work six to nine, then study two more hours?"

"I have Princeton early decision due in two weeks. I need every hour."

Ethan is quiet for a moment. "What if we did Friday session at eight instead of seven? After your shift ends. We could work on essays together instead of you doing it alone at eleven."

"That's later than scheduled."

"But more practical. You wouldn't be rushing from work, and we'd be actually collaborating instead of you working solo after hours."

It makes sense. And it means not working completely alone Friday nights, which is when the loneliness usually hits hardest.

"Okay. Friday at eight."

"Good."

At nine PM, we pack up. Walking out of the library together has become routine. The October night is cold enough that I wish I'd brought a heavier jacket.

"One week left," Ethan says. "Of mandated collaboration."

"Then we're technically free."

"But we're still working together on essays and applications."

"Academic partnership."

"Right. Academic."

Neither of us sounds convinced it's purely academic anymore.

"Ethan?" I stop at the path split. "Thanks. For listening. And not making it weird that I'm exhausted and broke and working too hard."

"Thanks for trusting me enough to admit it. And for listening to my anxiety stuff without making me feel broken."

"You're not broken."

"Neither are you."

We look at each other in the cold October night, two people who spent three years as rivals learning to actually see each other.

"Friday at eight," I confirm.

"See you then."

I watch him walk toward Thoreau Hall, then head to Whitman. In my room, I pull out my planner to adjust Friday's schedule. Moving the study session to eight means I actually have time to shower after my dining hall shift instead of rushing directly to the library.

Small adjustments. But they feel significant.

Like maybe I don't have to do everything alone anymore.

Like maybe letting someone help—even just adjusting a schedule—doesn't mean I'm failing.

Like maybe Ethan seeing my struggle doesn't make me weaker.

Maybe it just makes me human.
