# Chapter 1: The Weight of Perfect

The morning light slants across Cambridge Preparatory's main quad, turning the brick buildings golden and the lawns impossibly green. First day of senior year, and I notice the perfection everywhere—the precise trim of hedges, the symmetrical benches, the ivy climbing the library wall in exactly the right amount of picturesque decay.

Everything at Cambridge Prep looks effortless. That's the trick.

I adjust my blazer—navy wool, Cambridge Prep crest embroidered on the breast pocket—and check my watch. Eight forty-two. Eighteen minutes until my mandatory meeting with Dr. Morrison, the college counselor. Plenty of time to walk past Hamilton Academic Building where they posted the National Merit Scholar announcements last spring. My name was there. So was his.

Ethan Wallace.

Three years of being neck-and-neck with him in class rank, test scores, academic competitions. Three years of watching him collect the same awards, join the same honor societies, apply for scholarships I actually need while he does it for his résumé.

I refuse to tie for valedictorian.

The quad fills with returning students greeting each other, trading summer stories about European vacations and beach houses. The McAllister twins are tan from the Hamptons. Charlotte Preston shows off a designer bag. Marcus Chen describes a tech internship his father arranged.

I spent my summer waitressing near my parents' house in Worcester, saving for textbooks and application fees.

"Hannah! Wait up!"

Sarah McKenzie jogs across the quad, her blonde hair bouncing in its ponytail, still slightly out of breath. Sarah's my roommate—well, she was until this year. One of the perks of maintaining a 4.0 for three consecutive years is getting a single room. Privacy. No one watching me study until two in the morning or noticing when I'm too stressed to sleep at all.

"You're walking like you're heading to an execution," Sarah says, falling into step beside me. "It's just senior year."

"I have a meeting with Dr. Morrison."

"Already? School literally just started."

"Mandatory senior check-in." I don't mention the knot in my stomach. Mandatory meetings make me nervous—like something might be wrong with my scholarship or my place here.

Sarah loops her arm through mine. "You're going to be fine. You're Hannah Price. You've been fine at everything for three years."

I wish that made me feel better.

We part ways at the library steps. The hallways smell like floor polish and old wood. Through classroom windows, I see teachers setting up for first-day syllabi. Professor Brennan is writing something on the board in his AP Literature room, probably a quote meant to inspire us.

Dr. Morrison's office is at the end of the hall, her door propped open. I can see the Ivy League pennants on her wall—Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Columbia—and the framed photos of successful Cambridge Prep graduates who've gone on to impressive careers. Last year's valedictorian is up there now, heading to Stanford on a full ride.

That's going to be me. It has to be.

I knock on the doorframe. Dr. Morrison looks up from her computer and smiles. She's in her fifties, sharp-eyed and impeccably dressed in a way that makes me conscious of my off-brand oxford shirt under the required blazer. She knows every student's GPA, test scores, and extracurricular résumé by heart. Nothing gets past her.

"Hannah. Right on time. Come in, sit down."

I take the chair across from her desk, back straight, hands folded. Dr. Morrison studies me for a moment.

"How was your summer?"

"Productive. I worked, took an online writing course, finished my summer reading."

"Did you do anything fun?"

Fun feels like a luxury I can't afford. "I spent time with my family."

She doesn't push, just pulls up something on her computer. "Your academic record is exceptional. President of Academic Bowl, Debate Team captain, Community Service Club leadership—you've built an impressive profile."

Pride and anxiety twist together. "Thank you."

"You're ranked first in the senior class." She pauses. "Tied for first."

And there it is.

"With Ethan Wallace," I say.

"Yes. You're both applying to the same schools—Princeton, Yale, Columbia." Dr. Morrison leans back. "You're both exceptional. You should be proud."

I hear the "but" coming.

"However, colleges want more than grades now. Leadership, yes, but also collaboration. The ability to work with others as equals, not just lead them."

My throat tightens. "I'm on several teams—"

"You captain those teams," Dr. Morrison interrupts gently. "Partnership—genuine, equal partnership where you're not in charge—that's different. That's what I'll be looking for in my recommendation letters."

The threat is polite but unmistakable. She controls the recommendations that can make or break my applications.

"I understand."

"Good. I want to see you succeed, Hannah. I just want to make sure you're ready."

The meeting ends with vague encouragement. I walk out feeling like the ground shifted beneath me.

Tied for first. Still tied.

And now Dr. Morrison is hinting that being the best isn't enough.

Ashford Dining Hall at six o'clock is organized chaos. Long wooden tables arranged by house and grade, students in various states of uniform compliance. The smell of institutional food tries to disguise itself with herbs. Tonight: chicken, vegetables, pasta.

I find my usual spot near the windows where scholarship students and the Academic Bowl team sit. It's not officially designated, but social geography at Cambridge Prep is rigid. Legacy students cluster near the center. Athletes have their tables. Arts kids near the back. We sit here, united by merit, not family names.

Sarah slides her tray across from mine. "You survived Dr. Morrison."

"Barely." I stab at a piece of chicken. "She basically told me I need to be more collaborative."

"You? Miss I-Have-Everything-Organized-In-Color-Coded-Folders?" Sarah grins. "Shocking."

"I collaborate. I run three clubs."

"You run them. That's different from working with people as equals." Sarah's tone is gentle, but it stings because it's true. "When was the last time you worked on something where you weren't in charge?"

I don't have a good answer.

Across the dining hall, I spot Ethan Wallace at the center table, surrounded by legacy students. He's laughing at something Ryan Carter said, looking completely at ease in his perfectly fitted blazer. His dark hair is slightly too long to be regulation, but teachers never call him on it.

Ethan Wallace, whose family has a library wing named after them. Whose grandfather and father both attended Cambridge Prep before Princeton. Who gets the same perfect grades I do but makes it look easy, like he's barely trying while I grind myself to dust.

"You're staring at him again," Sarah says.

I snap my attention back to my tray. "I'm not staring. I'm observing the competition."

"You know that sounds unhinged, right?"

"He's the only thing between me and valedictorian."

"He's also a human person, not an obstacle to destroy." Sarah takes a bite of pasta, makes a face. "Maybe you'd be less stressed if you weren't in constant competition mode?"

"I can't afford to relax. He can." It comes out bitter.

Sarah sighs. "Hannah..."

"I'm fine. I just need senior year to go perfectly. Keep my grades up, ace my apps, get into Princeton. Then I'll relax."

"You said that about junior year."

"This time I mean it."

Sarah doesn't look convinced. We finish dinner making small talk about schedules and teachers. I have Professor Brennan for AP Lit again, which is good—he respects my work. Sarah got him too.

When I glance across the dining hall one more time, Ethan is looking in my direction. Our eyes meet for a fraction of a second before we both look away.

Three years of this. One more to go.

I'm going to win.

My dorm room in Whitman Hall is small but mine. Single bed, desk under the window, bookshelf filled with textbooks and color-coded binders. I've hung nothing on the walls. I'm here to work, not decorate.

I pull out my planner—physical, not digital, because writing helps me remember—and block out my fall schedule. Classes eight to three-fifteen. Academic Bowl Mondays and Wednesdays, four to six. Debate Team Tuesdays and Thursdays. Community Service Club Friday afternoons. Three nights weekly I bus tables in the dining hall—scholarship covers tuition and room, but I need income for books, supplies, application fees.

Study time: six-thirty to ten nightly, longer on weekends. SAT subject tests in October and November. Princeton early decision November first. Essays, forms, recommendations.

I write it all in fifteen-minute increments.

When I look up, it's past eleven. Outside, the quad is dark. Most students are settling in, enjoying the first night of senior year. I should sleep, but my mind won't stop.

Tied for first.

The phrase loops in my head like a song I can't stop humming.

I've worked too hard to share valedictorian. My parents are proud—they tell me every call—but they don't understand what it's like here. They think good grades should be enough. They don't see legacy students gliding through on family connections while I earn every decimal point. They don't know how exhausting it is to constantly prove I deserve my place.

I can't tell them. They've sacrificed enough.

So I'll do what I've always done: work harder than everyone else. Plan better. Execute perfectly. I'll beat Ethan Wallace through sheer determination and discipline.

I close my planner and get ready for bed. In the communal bathroom, I catch my reflection. I look tired. I always look tired.

But tired means working hard. And working hard is the only way to win.

Tomorrow, senior year really begins.

I have to be ready.
