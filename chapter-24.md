# Chapter 24: What Winning Costs

That evening, I sat in my dorm room with the valedictorian certificate Dr. Morrison had handed me after the assembly. Heavy cream paper with Cambridge Prep's seal embossed in gold, my name in formal script: Hannah Marie Price, Valedictorian, Class of [year].

It should have felt triumphant. Instead, it felt hollow.

Sarah came in from dinner, took one look at me, and sat on my bed. "Okay, what's wrong? You won. You're valedictorian. This is what you wanted."

"I know."

"So why do you look miserable?"

I set the certificate on my desk. "I keep thinking about what I gave up to get this. Three years of barely any friends besides you. No social life. No time for anything except studying and activities that would look good on college applications. I sacrificed everything to be first, and now that I am..." I trailed off.

"Now that you are, you're realizing it wasn't worth it?"

"Not the way I did it, no." I pulled my knees to my chest. "Sarah, I don't even remember most of freshman and sophomore year. It's just a blur of perfect grades and college prep. I was so focused on beating Ethan that I forgot to actually enjoy anything."

"And these past few months working with him?"

I smiled despite everything. "These past few months have been better than the previous three years combined."

"There's your answer." Sarah grabbed my AP Lit textbook and pretended to read it upside down. "Hannah Price spent three years grinding herself into dust to beat her rival, only to discover that the rival was actually the best thing about her Cambridge Prep experience. More at eleven."

"You're not helping."

"I'm absolutely helping. I'm pointing out that you already know the answer." She set down the book. "The perfect score isn't valedictorian. It's finding someone who makes you happy. And you found him. You just haven't fully admitted it yet."

"I've admitted it."

"To yourself, maybe. Not to him."

"That's different."

"How?"

"Because telling him changes everything." I hugged my knees tighter. "What if I'm wrong? What if he doesn't feel the same way? What if I ruin the partnership we've built?"

Sarah gave me a look of profound patience. "Hannah, that boy helped you write your valedictorian speech after losing to you by three hundredths of a point. He spent his Christmas break texting you about whether Heathcliff deserves redemption. He researches train schedules between New Haven and Princeton in case you end up at different schools. If you think he doesn't have feelings for you, you're being willfully blind."

Meanwhile, across campus in Thoreau Hall, a similar conversation was happening.

I didn't know this at the time, but Ryan told Sarah later, who told me the whole story: Ethan was sitting on his bed, staring at his own salutatorian certificate with the same hollow expression I probably had. The heavy paper with its gold seal and formal script announcing he'd come in second after four years of perfect work.

"Dude," Ryan said, looking up from his chemistry homework. "You came in second at one of the most competitive prep schools in the country. You beat three hundred eighteen other students. That's incredible."

"I know."

"So why do you look like someone just died?"

"I don't look like someone died."

"You absolutely do. You've been staring at that certificate for twenty minutes." Ryan sat in his desk chair backwards, giving Ethan his full attention. "This is about Hannah."

It wasn't a question. Ethan apparently didn't even try to deny it.

"I was genuinely relieved when she won," Ethan told Ryan. "I was happy for her. But sitting here now, looking at second place, I keep thinking about my father's reaction."

"Your father is disappointed about everything. That's his default state."

"He called tonight. Asked why I couldn't maintain a perfect record for four full years like Hannah did. Suggested that if I'd focused less on 'that collaboration requirement nonsense' and more on my studies, I might have finished first."

Ryan made a disgusted sound. "Your father is the worst."

"He's not wrong, though. If I hadn't spent six hours a week in Study Room 3B helping Hannah with essays and research papers—"

"You'd be more miserable, more anxious, and probably still second," Ryan interrupted. "Ethan, you've been happier these past few months than in the entire time I've known you. You laugh more. You stress less. You're honest about struggling instead of pretending everything's easy. That's because of Hannah and those study sessions."

"But second place—"

"Means nothing compared to finding someone who makes you better." Ryan leaned forward. "Look, I'm going to say something, and you're going to hate it, but someone needs to: you're in love with her."

Ethan apparently went very still.

"You're in love with Hannah Price," Ryan continued. "You have been for months. And based on how she looks at you, she's in love with you too. So instead of sitting here moping about three hundredths of a point, maybe do something about the actual important thing."

"Like what?"

"Like tell her."

"I can't just tell her."

"Why not?"

"Because we're partners. Study partners. If I tell her and she doesn't feel the same way, I ruin that. And that's the best part of Cambridge Prep."

Ryan shook his head. "You're both idiots. Brilliant, accomplished idiots, but idiots nonetheless."

Back in my dorm room, I was having similar thoughts. The valedictorian certificate sat on my desk, technically representing everything I'd worked toward. But the real achievement—the thing that actually mattered—was what I'd built with Ethan.

"I'm going to tell him," I said suddenly.

Sarah looked up. "Really?"

"Not tonight. He just lost valedictorian. But soon. Before graduation. I'm going to tell him how I feel."

"About time."

"I'm terrified."

"That's how you know it matters."

I thought about that as I got ready for bed, as I set my alarm for six AM to fit in studying before class. Sarah turned out her light and was asleep within minutes, but I lay awake thinking.

For three years, I'd measured success exclusively by grades and class rank and college acceptances. I'd sacrificed potential friendships and normal high school experiences and simple happiness—all for decimal points that ultimately meant almost nothing. The difference between first and second place was three hundredths of a grade point—basically a rounding error, a statistical insignificance over four years of relentless work.

But the difference between competing alone and partnering with someone who genuinely understood me, who challenged and supported me simultaneously? That was everything.

I'd won valedictorian. I'd gotten into Princeton. By every objective measure, I'd succeeded at Cambridge Prep.

But the real victory was quieter: learning to let someone in. Learning that asking for help wasn't weakness. Learning that the person pushing you hardest could also be the person supporting you most.

Ethan had taught me that. The past few months working together had taught me that.

And I was done pretending it was just about academics.

The next morning, I ran into Ethan in the library before first period. He was returning books, looking tired.

"Hey," I said.

"Hey, valedictorian." He smiled, but it didn't quite reach his eyes.

"Rough night?"

"My father called."

I didn't need him to elaborate. "I'm sorry."

"It's fine. Standard Wallace family dynamics." He shifted his bag. "How are you feeling about the whole thing?"

"Honestly? Strange. Like I won something that doesn't matter as much as I thought it would."

"What does matter?"

"This," I said, gesturing between us. "Study Room 3B. The research paper. Working together instead of competing. That matters more than three hundredths of a point."

Something shifted in Ethan's expression. "Yeah?"

"Definitely."

We stood in the library hallway, early morning light filtering through the tall windows, other students flowing around us heading to class.

"Hannah, I need to tell you something," Ethan said quietly.

My heart started pounding. "Okay."

"These past few months—working with you, getting to know you—it's been..." He paused, searching for words. "It's been the best part of Cambridge Prep. Better than chess club or perfect grades or any of it. You make everything better. And I don't mean just academically. I mean everything."

"Ethan—"

The first period bell rang, cutting me off. Students hurried past us toward classrooms. We were going to be late.

"We should talk," Ethan said. "Really talk. Not rushed before class."

"Tonight? Study Room 3B?"

"Seven PM?"

"I'll be there."

We headed to our separate classes, but I couldn't focus on AP Lit or calculus or anything except the conversation we were about to have. The one where everything would change.

I'd spent three years fighting to be first.

But I'd spent the past few months discovering that first place meant nothing without someone to share it with.

Tonight, I was going to tell Ethan that.

And hope he felt the same way.
