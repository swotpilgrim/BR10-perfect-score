# Chapter 26: Senior Awards Night

February arrived with relentless cold and mounting pressure. Regular decision college results would come in April. Graduation loomed in June. And in between, I had to write and deliver a valedictorian speech in front of the entire school community.

I sat in Study Room 3B—now officially our space as a couple, not just study partners—surrounded by crumpled drafts of speeches I'd written and rejected.

"This is impossible," I said, dropping my head to the table dramatically.

Ethan looked up from his Yale supplemental essays. "What's impossible?"

"Writing a speech that's honest without being too personal, meaningful without being cliché, funny without being inappropriate, and inspiring without being cheesy."

"That does sound impossible."

"Not helpful, Ethan."

He smiled and came around to my side of the table, reading over my shoulder. "Show me what you have."

I pulled up my latest draft—a safe, generic speech about achievement and gratitude and looking toward the future. All true. All boring.

"It's good," Ethan said carefully.

"But?"

"But it's not you. It sounds like every valedictorian speech ever given." He sat beside me. "What do you actually want to say?"

"That I spent three years measuring my worth in decimal points and almost missed the best part of Cambridge Prep because I was too focused on beating my rival to see that he could become my partner. And that the perfect score isn't the grade—it's finding someone who makes you better while accepting you exactly as you are."

"So say that."

"I can't give a speech about you in front of the entire school."

"Why not? Everyone knows we're together now. Professor Brennan smiled knowingly at us in class yesterday. Dr. Morrison looked smug when she saw us holding hands in the library. Sarah says it's the worst-kept secret at Cambridge Prep."

He wasn't wrong. Word had spread quickly after we'd started walking to class together, studying openly as a couple, kissing goodbye at the fork in the path. The whole school knew.

"It still feels too personal," I protested.

"The best speeches always are. You told me that when I was writing my Princeton essays."

I stared at my draft, then started deleting. If I was going to do this, I needed to be honest. Really honest.

Over the next week, I wrote and rewrote, cutting generic platitudes and replacing them with truth. Ethan read every draft, offering feedback that pushed me toward vulnerability instead of safety.

The night before Senior Awards Night, we sat in Study Room 3B with the final version.

"Read it out loud," Ethan said. "Like you're actually giving the speech."

I stood up, cleared my throat, and began:

*"Three years ago, I came to Cambridge Prep with one goal: prove I deserved to be here. I was the scholarship student from Worcester competing against legacy students with family names on library wings. So I decided to be perfect..."*

I read through the whole speech—about competition and isolation, about Dr. Morrison's forced collaboration, about learning that the person pushing you hardest could become the person who understood you best. About how winning meant nothing without connection.

When I finished, Ethan was smiling.

"It's perfect," he said.

"You have to say that. You're biased."

"I'm biased and it's perfect. Those things can both be true." He stood and wrapped his arms around me. "You're going to make people cry."

"That's not the goal."

"It's absolutely the goal."

Senior Awards Night arrived with nerve-wracking inevitability. Ashford Hall filled with parents, faculty, and students. My parents sat in the front row—my mother in her best dress, my father in a suit I'd never seen him wear. They looked proud and slightly overwhelmed.

Across the aisle, Ethan's parents sat with his sister. His father looked stern as always, but his mother smiled when she caught me looking.

Dr. Morrison took the podium to announce various awards and recognitions. National Merit Scholars. College athletic commitments. Academic team victories. Each announcement met with applause from families.

Finally: "And now, our valedictorian, Hannah Price, will address the senior class."

I stood on shaking legs and walked to the podium. The microphone felt too tall. The crowd looked enormous. My hands were sweating.

Then I found Ethan in the audience. He was smiling, nodding slightly. You've got this.

I took a breath and began.

"Three years ago, I came to Cambridge Prep with one goal: prove I deserved to be here. I was the scholarship student from Worcester competing against legacy students with family names on library wings. So I decided to be perfect. Perfect grades, perfect test scores, perfect everything. I thought if I could just be first in the class, valedictorian, I'd finally prove I belonged."

The room was silent, attentive.

"I achieved that goal. I'm standing here as valedictorian. But I almost missed the most important lesson Cambridge Prep had to teach me, because I was too focused on being perfect to be human."

I looked at Ethan again. He was listening intently.

"This fall, our college counselor did something I thought was cruel at the time. She mandated that my academic rival and I—the two students tied for first in the class—spend six weeks collaborating. Mandatory study sessions. Joint research projects. Forced partnership when all I wanted was to compete."

A few students laughed. They remembered the gossip about the mandate.

"I was furious. But Dr. Morrison was right. Those mandatory sessions taught me something more valuable than any perfect grade: that competition without respect is empty, and the person challenging you hardest can become the person who understands you best."

I paused, gathering courage for the personal part.

"Ethan Wallace has been my rival since freshman year. He's also the smartest person I know, the one who pushed me to be better, and—as of three months ago—my partner in every sense of the word. Losing valedictorian to him wouldn't have bothered me. Losing him would have destroyed me. That's when I knew: the perfect score isn't the grade or the rank. It's finding someone who makes you better while accepting you exactly as you are."

My mother was crying. I could see Sarah wiping her eyes. Even Professor Brennan looked moved.

"So my advice to the Class of [year] is this: compete, yes. Work hard, absolutely. But don't become so focused on being first that you forget to connect with the people running alongside you. The person next to you in class might challenge your GPA. They might also change your life. Let them."

I looked out at my classmates—the people I'd spent four years alongside, competing against, occasionally collaborating with.

"We're about to leave Cambridge Prep for colleges and careers and futures we can't fully imagine yet. We'll measure success in different ways—degrees earned, jobs secured, goals achieved. But I hope we also measure it in connections made, partnerships built, and moments when we chose vulnerability over perfection."

I glanced at my notes for the closing.

"Thank you to the faculty who challenged us, the families who supported us, and the classmates who made these four years memorable. And special thanks to Dr. Morrison, whose forced collaboration mandate taught me the most important lesson of my Cambridge Prep career: sometimes the best things come from requirements we initially resist."

Applause erupted. I stepped away from the podium, legs shaking, and returned to my seat. My parents were beaming. Ethan was grinning.

After the ceremony, families mingled with refreshments. My mother pulled me into a fierce hug.

"That was beautiful, sweetheart."

"Thanks, Mom."

"Is that Ethan?" She was looking across the room where Ethan stood with his parents.

"That's him."

"We should meet him. And his family."

My father agreed. We crossed the room in what felt like the longest walk of my life.

"Mr. and Mrs. Wallace?" my mother said. "I'm Linda Price, Hannah's mother. This is my husband Tom."

Ethan's mother smiled warmly. "Call me Catherine. This is my husband Richard, and our daughter Emily."

The parents made polite conversation while Ethan's father asked him about regular decision results. Emily pulled Ethan aside to whisper something that made him laugh.

"Your speech was lovely," Catherine said to me. "Very personal."

"Thank you."

"Ethan's told us about your partnership. He seems very happy."

I glanced at Ethan, who was now talking with my father about Princeton. "I'm happy too."

"That's what matters." Catherine squeezed my hand. "The rest is just logistics."

She sounded like my mother.

Maybe all mothers understood that love mattered more than logistics.

Later, after families had left and students returned to dorms, Ethan found me outside Ashford Hall.

"Your speech was perfect," he said.

"You're still biased."

"Still biased, still right." He took my hand. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For being brave enough to say it out loud. In front of everyone. That took courage."

"You make me brave."

"You were always brave. You just didn't know it." He kissed me softly. "Ready for spring semester? Regular decision stress, waiting for results, figuring out our future?"

"Ready as I'll ever be."

"Then let's go figure it out."

We walked back to the dorms hand in hand, facing an uncertain future but facing it together.

And that, I thought, was the real perfect score.
