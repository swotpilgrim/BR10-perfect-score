# Chapter 3: The Summons

The campus mailroom is in the administration building basement, windowless and smelling like paper. Each student has a small metal box—mine is 47-12-33, memorized since freshman year.

Three weeks into October, I've settled into senior year rhythm. Classes, clubs, studying, repeat. No room for surprises.

The cream-colored envelope in my mailbox makes my stomach drop.

Official Cambridge Prep stationery. My name typed on front. Inside, one sentence:

*Hannah, please see me in my office today at 3:00 PM. This is mandatory.*

I read it three times. Mandatory. Not "when you have time." Mandatory.

My hands shake as I fold the note.

Mandatory meetings mean problems. Financial aid issues. Scholarship reviews. Three years at Cambridge Prep taught me "mandatory" means trouble.

First period is a blur. I barely register Sarah or AP Lit discussion. All I can think about is three o'clock. My grades are perfect. I haven't violated rules. Scholarship paperwork submitted on time. I've been careful.

Unless I missed something. Some requirement I didn't fulfill, some form I forgot.

By lunch, I've constructed seventeen worst-case scenarios.

"You're not eating," Sarah says.

"Not hungry."

"What's going on?"

I slide her the note. She reads, frowns. "Dr. Morrison wants to see you. That's not automatically bad."

"It says mandatory."

"Everything here is mandatory. You're spiraling. She probably just wants to check about your Princeton application."

"Then why not say that?"

I fold the note smaller and smaller. "What if it's about my scholarship?"

"Why would it be? You have a 4.0."

"Maybe they're cutting funding. Maybe—"

"Hannah." Sarah stills my hands. "You're catastrophizing. Go to the meeting. It's probably nothing. And if it's something, you'll deal with it."

I want to believe her. The knot in my stomach doesn't loosen.

---

At 2:55, I'm outside Dr. Morrison's office, five minutes early. The hallway is quiet. I smooth my blazer, run through possible reasons for this summons.

Footsteps echo. I look up.

Ethan Wallace rounds the corner, slowing when he sees me. We stare at each other.

"Three o'clock meeting?" he asks.

"Yes."

"With Dr. Morrison?"

"Yes."

Awkward silence. Ethan shifts, glances at the door.

"Did your note say what it's about?" I ask.

"No. Just 'mandatory meeting at three.'" He runs a hand through his hair. "You don't know either?"

"No idea."

This is our longest non-academic conversation. I notice tension in his shoulders, tightness around his eyes. He's worried too, hiding it better than me.

"Maybe it's about Academic Challenge," Ethan offers. "Or some senior requirement."

"Maybe."

But other team members would be here for that. This feels specific. Personal.

The door opens. Dr. Morrison appears in a navy suit.

"Hannah. Ethan. Right on time. Come in."

We file in like students called to the principal. Dr. Morrison gestures to chairs. We sit, leaving space between us.

She settles into her chair, pulls up something on her computer, studies us.

"I'm sure you're wondering why I called you both here."

We nod in unison.

"Your college applications are progressing well. Both of you are applying to Princeton, Yale, and Columbia as your top choices."

Dread pools in my stomach. I knew Ethan was applying to Princeton—he's legacy—but hearing our identical strategy laid out makes the competition viscerally real.

"Both of you have exceptional GPAs, test scores, and involvement. On paper, you're ideal candidates." Dr. Morrison turns her monitor. A spreadsheet comparing our applications side by side.

Hannah Price | Ethan Wallace
4.0 GPA | 4.0 GPA
SAT: 1570 | SAT: 1580
President, Academic Bowl | President, Chess Club
Captain, Debate Team | Captain, Academic Decathlon
National Merit Scholar | National Merit Scholar

Mirror images. Perfectly matched competitors.

"You're both accomplished students. But there's a problem."

Here it comes. The scholarship issue.

"You're both individualists. Brilliant individualists, but individualists nonetheless." She leans back. "Look at your leadership positions. Hannah, you're president or captain of every organization. Ethan, same. You lead. You organize. Valuable skills."

"Thank you," I say cautiously.

"But top-tier colleges don't just want leaders. They want collaborators. People who can work with others as equals, not just direct them. Neither of you demonstrates that skill."

Relief that this isn't about my scholarship turns to defensive irritation. "I work with my team constantly."

"You work *above* them," Dr. Morrison corrects. "As captain. As president. That's different from genuine partnership."

Ethan speaks, voice neutral. "With respect, leadership is usually what colleges look for."

"Leadership, yes. But not exclusively. Recommendation forms ask about ability to collaborate, to compromise, to work without being in charge." She pulls out two sheets. "Your recommendation questionnaires from teachers and advisors. Summary: Brilliant. Hardworking. Excellent leaders. And notable absence of equal partnership examples."

My face heats. "I collaborate. Group projects, team competitions—"

"In which you typically organize and delegate. Leadership. But can you name one significant project where you worked with someone as an equal partner? Where neither of you was in charge?"

I open my mouth. Close it. Nothing comes to mind.

Dr. Morrison looks at Ethan. "Same question."

Ethan's jaw tightens. "Academic work tends to be individual at this level."

"It doesn't have to be. And colleges increasingly want collaborative work evidence. Research partnerships. Study groups where everyone contributes equally. Projects depending on genuine teamwork, not one person directing."

The air feels thick. I'm aware of Ethan eighteen inches away, probably feeling the same defensive frustration.

"So what are you saying? That our applications are incomplete?"

"I'm saying they'd be stronger—significantly stronger—with collaborative experience examples. Real partnership. Right now, neither of you has that." Dr. Morrison folds her hands. "Which presents a challenge for my recommendation letters."

There's the leverage. She controls the recommendations Princeton, Yale, and Columbia require. The ones that can make or break applications.

"Are you saying you won't write our recommendations?" Ethan's voice is tight.

"I'm saying I'll write accurate recommendations. Excellent in many ways and notably lacking in one specific, increasingly important way." Dr. Morrison's expression is kind but firm. "I want you both to succeed. You're exceptional students. But you're incomplete candidates. I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't point that out."

"So what do we do? It's October. Applications are due in weeks. How are we supposed to develop partnership skills on that timeline?"

"That is an excellent question. And I have a proposal."

Ethan and I exchange wary glances.

"But before I explain, you need to understand something. This isn't punishment. This is about making you better candidates and better people. The ability to work with others as equals—to share credit, to compromise, to value someone else's input—that's a life skill, not just an application requirement. You'll need it in college, careers, every meaningful relationship."

The lecture lands with uncomfortable accuracy. I don't want to admit she's right, but I lack counterarguments.

"So here's what I'm proposing. Before you object, hear me out completely."

I grip the chair arms, bracing myself.

"You two are going to work together. Real collaboration, genuine partnership, for the next six weeks. You'll meet regularly, complete a joint project, and learn to function as equals rather than competitors."

The words hit like cold water.

"Absolutely not," I say.

"That's not feasible," Ethan says simultaneously.

We glare at each other for arguing in unison.

Dr. Morrison holds up a hand. "I said hear me out. Six weeks. Three sessions weekly, two hours minimum. You'll work on a research project of your choosing, provide feedback on each other's college essays, and demonstrate genuine collaborative effort. At the end, you'll have concrete partnership examples for applications and I'll have genuine collaborative experience to reference in my recommendations."

"He's my competition," I blurt. "We're applying to the same schools. Why would I help him improve his applications?"

"Why would I risk my Princeton acceptance by working with someone who might sabotage my essays?" Ethan adds.

"Because your applications are currently tied at equal. You'll both be strong candidates or both be weak. Working together doesn't change that balance—it raises you both to a higher level. And frankly, Princeton isn't going to choose between two identical candidates. They'll take the ones who show something unique. Collaboration experience makes you unique."

I want to argue. Find the flaw, the loophole.

But she's right. We both know it.

"What if we refuse?" Ethan asks quietly.

Dr. Morrison's expression doesn't change. "Then I write accurate letters noting your exceptional individual achievements and notable lack of collaborative experience. You apply to Princeton, Yale, and Columbia with incomplete applications." She pauses. "Your choice."

It's not a choice. It's coercion dressed as guidance.

I look at Ethan. He's staring at the desk, jaw clenched, running through the same calculations. We're trapped. Forced into partnership by the one person who controls a crucial piece of our applications.

"When would this start?" I ask, defeated.

"Friday evening. Study Room 3B, Wellington Library. Seven PM." Dr. Morrison pulls out two schedules, slides one to each of us. "Three sessions weekly, two hours minimum. I'll check in periodically. At six weeks' end, you'll present your joint project and demonstrate what you've learned."

Six weeks. Eighteen sessions. Thirty-six hours minimum with Ethan Wallace, my rival, the person between me and everything I've worked for.

This is a nightmare.

"Do we have a choice?" Ethan asks.

"You always have a choice. But the consequences of not participating would be... unfortunate for your applications."

Administrative speak for "no choice."

Ethan takes his schedule. After a moment, I take mine.

"Excellent." Dr. Morrison's smile is warm, like she hasn't just derailed our senior years. "I'll see you both Friday at seven. Come prepared to work together. Really together."

We're dismissed.

In the hallway, we stand in stunned silence.

"This is insane," I say.

"Agreed."

"Six weeks."

"I can count."

We look at each other, united for the first time by mutual frustration.

"I'm not sabotaging your applications," Ethan says.

"I'm not sabotaging yours either."

"Fine."

"Fine."

Silence.

"Friday at seven," he says.

"I'll be there."

"So will I."

We walk away in opposite directions, both trapped in the same impossible situation.
