Admits she spent three years obsessed with valedictorian, sacrificing friendships and experiences, measuring worth in decimal points. Room gets very quiet - this isn't typical speech.
3. Hannah looks directly at Ethan. Publicly thanks Ethan Wallace for three years of rivalry that pushed her to be better, and for past few months of partnership that taught her something more important than winning. Says real excellence isn't beating others - it's finding people who challenge and support you simultaneously. Competition without respect is empty; achievement without connection is hollow.

Father doesn't understand but Ethan doesn't care about his approval anymore. Liberation in that realization.
3. Outside hall, Hannah finds Ethan on quad. February air is cold, campus lights illuminate patches of snow. She asks if she embarrassed him by mentioning him so directly in speech. Ethan says it was best part - someone finally acknowledged competition can be complicated and connection matters more than rank.

Ethan agrees - Study Room 3B is where he learned to stop performing, where he could admit anxiety and imperfection without judgment. Room transformed them.
3. Talk about what happens next. Regular decision results come in April. Hannah committed to Princeton. Ethan might get in off deferral, might end up at Yale or Columbia. Either way, they're not letting college separate what they've built. Distance between New Haven and Princeton is manageable.
