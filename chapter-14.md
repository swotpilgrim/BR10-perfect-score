# Chapter 14: Study Break

Saturday evening, and Sarah is holding a dress she's deemed appropriate for the fall formal while I explain, for the third time, why I'm not going.

"I have SAT prep. Essay revisions. Princeton responses come in three weeks—"

"You need to be seventeen for one night." Sarah shakes the dress at me. "One dance won't destroy your applications."

"I don't have anything to wear."

"You have this." She holds up a deep green dress. "Borrowed from my cousin. It'll fit perfectly."

It's beautiful—simple, elegant, nothing like the designer gowns most girls will wear. But it's something.

"I don't dance."

"Neither does anyone else. We all just sway awkwardly."

"Hannah." Sarah's voice is serious. "When was the last time you did something just for fun?"

I open my mouth, then realize I can't remember. Everything is calculated—study sessions, work shifts, Academic Bowl. Even free time gets filled with applications.

"Exactly," Sarah says. "Come to the dance. Two hours. If you hate it, leave early."

I hesitate. But Sarah's right that I've been working nonstop.

"Fine. Two hours."

"Deal!" Sarah jumps up. "Get dressed. We're leaving in thirty minutes."

An hour later, I'm in Ashford Hall wearing the green dress, feeling out of place. String lights, fall decorations, music too loud for conversation. Students in designer gowns and tailored suits that cost more than my family's monthly rent.

Most girls wear dresses worth hundreds. Custom tailoring, expensive jewelry, professional styling. I'm wearing borrowed fabric and drugstore-curling-iron hair.

"You look great," Sarah says. "Stop comparing yourself."

"I'm not—"

"You're absolutely comparing. Stop." She squeezes my hand. "Come on."

We navigate toward the refreshment table. Jennifer Campbell stands near the dance floor in navy, surrounded by her circle. She notices me, eyebrows raising—surprise that the scholarship student showed up.

I ignore her and focus on punch.

Sarah spots Ryan and waves. He heads over, leaving me alone by the table, trying to look like I belong.

I'm debating whether fifteen minutes counts as giving it a fair try when I spot Ethan.

He's near the windows. Jennifer Campbell is talking to him—clearly flirting. Touching his arm, standing too close. Ethan's expression is polite but uncomfortable.

I should look away.

But I keep watching as she leans closer, making Ethan step back. He's trapped, too polite to walk away but looking for an exit.

Then his eyes scan the room and land on me.

Something shifts in his expression. Relief. He says something to Jennifer and extracts himself. She looks annoyed, but he's already moving.

Toward me.

My heart does something complicated.

"Hannah." Ethan reaches the table, slightly breathless. "You came."

"Sarah insisted."

"You look... different."

"I'm wearing a dress instead of uniform. That's what 'different' means at formal events."

"I meant it as a compliment."

"Oh." I don't know what to do with that. "You look the same. But in a suit."

Ethan laughs. "Also a compliment?"

"Observation."

Awkward silence. Around us, music plays and students dance. But Ethan and I have only ever interacted in Study Room 3B, surrounded by books. Standing at a dance in formal clothing feels foreign.

"The decorations are nice," I try.

"Very festive."

"Student Council did a good job."

More silence.

"We're terrible at this," Ethan says.

"At what?"

"Social interaction that isn't academic. We've spent six weeks analyzing Morrison's correspondence and editing essays. We never learned normal conversation."

"We had normal conversations. About anxiety and family pressure."

"Those were real. This is small talk. We're bad at small talk."

He's right. We went from rivals to honesty without learning the casual middle ground.

A slow song starts. Couples move toward the dance floor. Ethan glances at them, then at me.

"Do you want to dance?"

The question catches me off guard. "Dance?"

"Yes. That thing people do at dances."

"I know what dancing is."

"Then do you want to?"

I should say no. Dancing feels dangerous—too personal, crossing some line from partners to something else.

But I hear myself say, "Okay."

Ethan leads me to the floor. He puts one hand on my waist, careful. I put my hand on his shoulder. Our other hands meet between us.

We sway to music, and it's strange and awkward and somehow right.

"I've never seen you at a school dance before," Ethan says quietly.

"I don't usually come. Too expensive—tickets, dresses, all of it. And I usually have work."

"But not tonight?"

"Sarah confiscated my laptop and threatened to hide it until I agreed to come. She can be terrifyingly persistent."

"Remind me never to argue with Sarah."

We sway in silence. I'm hyperaware of where Ethan's hand rests on my waist, the way we're close enough that I can smell his cologne—something subtle and expensive—the fact that this is the most physical contact we've ever had.

It's just dancing. People dance at school events all the time. It doesn't mean anything.

Except it feels like it means something.

"We have two weeks left," Ethan says. "Of mandated collaboration."

"I know."

"Dr. Morrison's requirement ends after eight weeks. We're at week six."

"Why are you mentioning this now?"

Ethan's quiet for a moment, still swaying to the music. "Because I'm not sure I want it to end."

My breath catches. "The mandate?"

"The sessions. Working together. I know it started as forced partnership, but..." He trails off.

"But it's not forced anymore," I finish quietly.

"No. It's not."

We keep dancing, neither of us addressing what we're actually talking about. That somewhere between hostile rivalry and academic partnership, something shifted. That Study Room 3B became a place where we're honest with each other in ways we're not with anyone else. That I look forward to Monday and Wednesday and Friday sessions more than any other part of my week.

That I'm terrified of what happens when the mandate ends and we don't have an excuse to spend six hours together weekly.

"We're both applying to Princeton," I say. "We're still competing for valedictorian. Even after the mandate ends, we're rivals."

"Are we? Still rivals?"

"We're tied for first rank. We're applying to the same school. That's the definition of rivals."

"Or it's the definition of people with similar goals who could support each other instead of competing."

The song is ending. Around us, couples separate, moving off the dance floor or waiting for the next song. But Ethan and I stand still, facing each other.

"I don't know how to do that," I admit. "Support instead of compete. I've spent three years viewing you as the obstacle to everything I want."

"And I've spent three years viewing you the same way." Ethan's hand is still on my waist. "But maybe we were wrong. Maybe we're not obstacles. Maybe we're..."

"What?"

"I don't know yet."

The honesty of it—the fact that he doesn't have an answer any more than I do—makes something in my chest loosen.

A faster song starts playing. The moment breaks. Ethan drops his hand from my waist, stepping back to appropriate distance.

"Thank you for the dance," he says formally.

"You're welcome."

We return to opposite sides of the room. Ethan gets pulled into conversation with Ryan and some Academic Bowl teammates. Sarah finds me by the refreshment table, grinning knowingly.

"You danced with Ethan Wallace."

"Briefly. One song."

"You like him."

"I respect his academic abilities—"

"Hannah. You like him."

I don't answer. Because Sarah's right, and admitting it feels dangerous.

I like Ethan Wallace. Somewhere between arguing about research proposals and editing each other's essays and admitting our exhaustion, I started liking him. Not as a rival or academic partner.

As Ethan. The person who defends me against Jennifer's cruelty. Who listens when I talk about financial pressure. Who shares his anxiety and family expectations. Who makes me feel less alone in the performance pressure of Cambridge Prep.

"It's terrifying," I say quietly. "Liking someone I'm competing against."

"Maybe you don't have to compete. Maybe you could both succeed."

"We can't both be valedictorian."

"Does that actually matter as much as you think it does?"

The question stops me. Valedictorian has been my goal since freshman year. The recognition, the achievement, the proof that a scholarship student deserves to be here. Of course it matters.

But standing here, thinking about Ethan's hand on my waist and the way we talked honestly while swaying to music, I'm not sure it matters more than what we're building in Study Room 3B.

Which is a terrifying realization.

"I should go," I say. "I've been here almost two hours. That was the deal."

"Running away from feelings?"

"Strategically retreating to process them in private."

Sarah laughs. "Fair enough. But Hannah? Whatever you're feeling about Ethan? It's okay to feel it. You're allowed to like someone even if it's complicated."

I hug her goodnight and head back to Whitman Hall. The November night is cold, frost already forming on the grass. Campus is quiet except for music drifting from Ashford Hall behind me.

In my room, I change out of the borrowed dress and into comfortable clothes. Sit at my desk. Open my laptop to work on Columbia supplemental essay.

But I can't focus.

I keep thinking about dancing with Ethan. The way he said he didn't want the sessions to end. The question of whether we're still rivals or something else now.

Two weeks left in the mandate. Fourteen days of required collaboration, and then we're technically free to stop meeting.

Except I don't want to stop.

I want Monday evenings in Study Room 3B. Want Wednesday archive sessions. Want Friday nights editing essays together.

Want the one place where I don't have to be perfect-Hannah, where I can admit I'm exhausted and struggling and still be enough.

Ethan asked if we're still rivals.

I don't know the answer.

But I know that when I think about him, my heart does something complicated that has nothing to do with academic competition.

And that terrifies me more than any college application ever could.
