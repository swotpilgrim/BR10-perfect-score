# Chapter 20: Early Decision Results

December fifteenth arrived with brutal cold that turned the Cambridge Prep quad into a landscape of ice and frozen grass. I spent the morning unable to focus on anything except the clock. Four PM—when Princeton's portal would update. When Ethan and I would find out if four years of perfect grades had been enough.

We'd agreed to check results together in Study Room 3B.

I couldn't eat lunch. Sarah dragged me to the dining hall anyway, forcing half a sandwich into my hands.

"You're going to get in," she said for the seventeenth time.

"You don't know that."

"Perfect GPA, perfect test scores, incredible essays. You've earned this."

"Ethan's done everything possible too."

Sarah gave me a look. "And you're worried about him."

"Of course I'm worried. We both applied. They're probably not taking both of us." I couldn't finish the thought.

"Deferral isn't the end of the world," Sarah said gently.

It felt like the end of the world.

The afternoon crawled by with excruciating slowness. AP Lit was a blur. Calculus was worse. By three-thirty I was sitting in Study Room 3B with my laptop closed, staring at the door, waiting for Ethan.

He arrived at three forty-five, looking as terrible as I felt. His hair was disheveled like he'd been running his hands through it, and his usual careful composure had cracked around the edges.

"Hey," he said.

"Hey."

He sat down across from me at our table—where we'd argued about *Wuthering Heights* and reviewed essays and slowly stopped being enemies.

"So," I said.

"So."

Through the window, I could see other students walking across the quad. None of them were about to find out if their entire future was about to change.

"What time is it?" Ethan asked.

"Three fifty-two."

"Eight minutes."

"Are you nervous?"

"Terrified. You?"

"I'm going to throw up."

He smiled despite everything. "Try to contain yourself."

My laptop sat closed in front of me. Ethan's sat closed in front of him. At four PM, we'd open them, log into the Princeton portal, and click the button that would reveal our results. One of us would see "Congratulations." One of us would see "After careful consideration."

"Hannah," Ethan said quietly.

I looked up.

"Whatever happens—" He paused, searching for words. "Whatever the results are, I want you to know that these past few months have been the best part of my time at Cambridge Prep. Not because of the collaboration requirement or the research paper or even the college application help. Because of you."

My throat felt tight. "Ethan—"

"Let me finish." He leaned forward. "You made me better. Not just as a student or an applicant. As a person. You made me stop performing and start being honest. You saw through all my bullshit and called me on it and somehow that made me feel less alone than I've felt in years. So regardless of what happens at four PM, I need you to know that."

I blinked hard against the sudden burning in my eyes. "You did the same for me. You were the first person at Cambridge Prep who made me feel like I belonged. Not like I'd earned my spot through grinding harder than everyone else, but like I actually deserved to be here. That mattered more than you know."

"So we're agreed that no matter what the portal says, we're okay?"

"We're okay," I confirmed.

"Good." He checked his watch. "Five minutes."

"Five minutes."

My hands were shaking. I folded them in my lap so Ethan wouldn't see, but from the way he was gripping the edge of the table, his hands were shaking too.

"Do you want to count down?" I asked.

"God, no. Let's just do it when it hits four."

We waited. The clock on my phone ticked over: 3:58. 3:59.

4:00.

I opened my laptop. Ethan opened his. We both logged into the Princeton portal with fingers that fumbled on the keys. The page loaded with agonizing slowness—the university crest, the applicant portal interface, the button that said "View Decision."

"On three?" Ethan asked.

"On three."

"One."

"Two."

"Three."

We clicked simultaneously.

My screen loaded.

"Congratulations! You have been accepted to Princeton University, Class of..."

The words swam in my vision. Accepted. I was accepted to Princeton. Three years of perfect grades, countless sleepless nights, every sacrifice my family had made—it had worked. I was going to Princeton.

I should have been ecstatic. I should have been screaming with joy.

But I couldn't celebrate until I knew Ethan's result.

I looked up. He was staring at his laptop screen, expression carefully blank in a way that made my stomach drop.

"Ethan?" My voice came out small.

He closed his laptop slowly. "After careful consideration, we have deferred your application to the regular decision pool."

Deferred. Not accepted.

The room went completely silent except for the heating system clicking on with a soft hiss.

"I'm sorry," I whispered.

"Don't be." His voice was steady, but I could see his hands shaking on top of his closed laptop. "This was always the likely outcome. Princeton doesn't usually take multiple students from the same school for early decision. Your application was stronger. You deserved this."

"That's not—"

"It is true, Hannah. And I'm genuinely happy for you. You earned this. Princeton is lucky to have you." He stood up, gathering his laptop. "Congratulations. Really."

"Ethan, wait—"

"I'm fine. I expected this. I'm just going to—I need some air. I'll see you later, okay?"

He was out the door before I could respond, moving quickly like he needed to escape before his careful composure cracked completely.

I sat alone in Study Room 3B with my Princeton acceptance letter glowing on my laptop screen. This was supposed to be the best moment of my high school career. The culmination of four years of perfect performance. The validation that all my family's sacrifices hadn't been in vain.

Instead I felt hollow.

I closed my laptop and stared at the window. Outside, December darkness was already settling over campus even though it was only four in the afternoon. The quad lights were coming on, illuminating patches of ice and frozen grass.

My phone buzzed with texts—Sarah asking for results, my mother checking in, classmates who'd heard through the grapevine that decisions were out today. I ignored all of them.

All I could think about was Ethan's face when he'd read his deferral letter. The way his hands had shaken. The way he'd congratulated me before leaving, genuine despite his own disappointment.

I'd spent three years wanting to beat Ethan Wallace. Wanting to prove I was better, smarter, more deserving. I'd gotten what I wanted—I was going to Princeton and he'd been deferred.

But winning felt awful.

I packed up and headed back to Whitman Hall. Sarah was waiting, bouncing with anticipation.

"Well?"

"I got in."

"Hannah! That's amazing!" She hugged me. When she pulled back, she searched my face. "What's wrong?"

"Ethan got deferred."

"Oh." Understanding dawned. "Oh, Hannah."

"I'm going to Princeton and he's not. I should be happy." I sat on my bed. "Why don't I feel happy?"

"Because you care about him more than you care about beating him." Sarah sat beside me. "That happened a while ago."

I thought about Ethan leaving with that blank expression. About how the acceptance felt meaningless when he was hurting.

"I need to find him."

"He probably needs time alone first."

I pulled out my phone. Three texts from the last five minutes.

**Ethan:** Sorry I left so abruptly. Needed to process. Congrats again on Princeton. You earned it.

**Ethan:** I mean that, by the way. I'm genuinely happy for you.

**Ethan:** And I'm not giving up. Deferral just means I need to strengthen my application for regular decision. We'll figure it out.

I stared at those messages—Ethan being supportive while dealing with his own disappointment. Ethan already planning next steps. Ethan saying "we'll figure it out" like my success hadn't ended our partnership.

I typed back:

**Hannah:** I'm sorry. I wish we'd both gotten in.

**Ethan:** Me too. But that's not how it works.

**Hannah:** Are you okay?

A long pause. The typing indicator appeared and disappeared several times.

**Ethan:** I will be. Just need tonight to be disappointed. Tomorrow we start working on making regular decision happen.

**Hannah:** We?

**Ethan:** You're not getting rid of me that easily. We still have that journal submission to work on. And I'm going to need help strengthening my application.

**Hannah:** Whatever you need. I'm here.

**Ethan:** I know. That's the best part of all this.

I read that message three times. The best part of all this. Not getting into Princeton. The best part was knowing I was here.

"What did he say?" Sarah asked.

"That he'll be okay. That we'll work on his regular decision application." I set my phone down. "That I'm the best part of all this."

Sarah smiled. "You realize you're completely in love with him, right?"

"I—" I started to protest, then stopped. She was right. I was in love with Ethan Wallace. I'd probably been in love with him since November. I'd been too afraid to admit it.

But I loved him. Loved the way he challenged and supported me simultaneously. Loved his terrible opinions about Heathcliff. Loved that he made me believe I belonged.

"Yeah," I said quietly. "I'm in love with him."

"Are you going to tell him?"

"Not tonight. He just got deferred." I looked at my phone, at his gracious messages. "But eventually."

Sarah squeezed my hand. "I think he feels the same way."

I thought about Ethan researching train schedules over Thanksgiving. About him saying these months had been the best part of Cambridge Prep. About him congratulating me despite his own disappointment.

Maybe she was right.

But tonight, I wasn't going to celebrate my acceptance or confess my feelings. Tonight, I was going to sit with the strange hollow feeling of winning something that had cost someone I loved.

Tomorrow, we'd figure out how to get Ethan into Princeton for regular decision.

Tomorrow, we'd be partners again, working together instead of competing.

Tomorrow.

But tonight, I let myself admit that getting into Princeton mattered less than Ethan's happiness. That winning felt awful when it came at his expense.

That somewhere between Study Room 3B and late-night walks across the quad, I'd stopped being a competitor and started being someone in love.

And that changed everything.
