# Chapter 8: The Cracks Show

Friday evening, 7:05 PM. Ethan and I are twenty minutes into our session in Study Room 3B, discussing how to structure our research paper, when the fire alarm shatters the quiet.

The harsh electronic shriek fills the library. Emergency lights flash in the hallway.

"You've got to be kidding me," I mutter, already saving my laptop document.

"Fire drill," Ethan says, grabbing his bag. "Mandatory evacuation."

We join the stream of students and faculty filing out of Wellington Library. It's October evening, cold enough that I'm grateful I wore my blazer. The sky is deep purple, stars just beginning to appear. Campus safety directs everyone to the lawn in front of the library—standard evacuation procedure.

About thirty people cluster on the lawn, mostly students who'd been studying on a Friday night instead of at parties or mixers. I recognize a few juniors from Academic Bowl, some seniors I know from classes. And unfortunately, Jennifer Campbell with two friends from Student Council.

Jennifer's eyes land on me and Ethan standing together. Her expression sharpens with interest.

"Hannah. Ethan." She approaches, flanked by Madison Porter and Claire Chen. "Studying together on a Friday night? How... dedicated."

There's poison under the sweetness.

"Research project," I say evenly.

"Right. Dr. Morrison's collaboration mandate." Jennifer smiles. "The whole school's heard about it. Forcing you two to work together because you're both terrible at playing well with others."

My face heats, but I keep my expression neutral. "Dr. Morrison thought we'd benefit from partnership experience."

"Is that what we're calling it?" Jennifer tilts her head. "Because from what I hear, you're spending an awful lot of time together. Three sessions a week, right? Two hours each? That's six hours weekly of Hannah Price getting exclusive access to Ethan Wallace."

"It's school-mandated collaboration," Ethan says, voice flat. "Not social time."

"Of course." Jennifer's smile doesn't reach her eyes. "I'm just saying it's convenient. Hannah's ranked first—tied with you, Ethan—and now she gets six hours weekly to... what? Study your methods? Sabotage your applications? Figure out how to beat you?"

The implication lands like a slap. That I'm using the collaboration to gain unfair advantage. That I'm manipulating the situation.

"That's not—" I start.

"Or maybe it's the opposite," Jennifer continues, warming to her theme. "Maybe Ethan's using the sessions to undermine you. Legacy student helping out the scholarship kid, how charitable. Though I'm sure it's just coincidence you're both applying to Princeton."

Madison and Claire watch with interest. Other students on the lawn are starting to notice the conversation, attention drifting our way.

My throat is tight. I should defend myself, say something cutting, shut Jennifer down. But the words won't come because part of me has wondered the same thing—is Ethan using our sessions for advantage? Am I?

"Jennifer."

Ethan's voice is cold in a way I've never heard. Not angry. Ice-cold.

"You've been ranked third in our class for three years. Three years of watching Hannah and me tie for first while you sit at number three. That must be frustrating."

Jennifer's smile falters.

"And now we're collaborating—working together instead of against each other—and you're threatened. Because if Hannah and I are both strong candidates, both improved by partnership, where does that leave you?" Ethan's tone is conversational, but the words cut. "Still third. Still shut out. Still watching from the outside."

"I wasn't—"

"If anyone's worried about unfair advantage, it's you," Ethan continues. "Worried that collaboration makes us better candidates while you're still playing the same competitive game. Worried that colleges will take students who demonstrate partnership skills over students who only know how to lead." He pauses. "You're president of Student Council. When was the last time you worked with someone as an actual equal?"

The silence is pointed.

Jennifer's face flushes. "You don't know what you're talking about."

"I know you've spent three years making snide comments about Hannah's scholarship status. I know you use phrases like 'people like her' when talking about financial aid students. And I know you're worried that when Princeton looks at our applications—mine, Hannah's, and yours—they'll take the ones who can actually collaborate." Ethan's expression doesn't change. "So maybe focus less on our study sessions and more on developing some humility."

Jennifer stares at him, speechless. Madison and Claire suddenly find the ground very interesting.

Then Jennifer spins on her heel and stalks away, her friends trailing behind.

The lawn is very quiet. Several students are pretending they didn't just witness that exchange. A few look openly impressed.

I'm frozen. Ethan defended me. Again. In front of witnesses, against someone who's made my life difficult since freshman year, he stood up for me.

"You didn't have to do that," I say quietly.

"Yes, I did." Ethan's voice is back to normal, the ice gone. "Jennifer's been awful to you for years. Someone should have shut her down earlier."

"Why you?"

"Because I was standing here. Because what she said was unfair. Because—" He stops, shrugs. "Because no one should have to listen to that garbage."

The fire alarm cuts off. Campus safety announces the all-clear. Students begin filing back into the library.

Ethan and I walk back together, neither speaking. My mind is spinning. Jennifer's accusation—that I might be using our sessions for advantage—echoes uncomfortably. Is that what people think? That the scholarship student is manipulating the situation?

Back in Study Room 3B, the atmosphere feels different. Slightly less hostile. The shared experience of Jennifer's attack has created an unexpected alliance.

We sit down. Ethan pulls out his laptop. "Where were we?"

"Dividing writing responsibilities," I say, grateful he's not dwelling on the confrontation.

"Right. You're handling biographical background and historical context. I'm analyzing the diplomatic correspondence for themes about class and education."

"We should probably draft sections separately, then trade and edit each other's work," I suggest. "Make sure they connect coherently."

"That works. Target length for each section?"

"Maybe a thousand words each? Gives us room for introduction and conclusion."

Ethan makes notes. "Timeline?"

"I can have my section drafted by Wednesday. We can trade then?"

"Sounds good."

We spend the next thirty minutes outlining our respective sections, identifying key points we each need to cover, discussing how to make our arguments connect. It's the most productive planning session we've had—focused, efficient, actually collaborative.

My phone buzzes in my bag. I ignore it. It buzzes again. And again.

"Someone really wants to talk to you," Ethan observes.

I pull out my phone. Three missed calls from my mother, plus texts: *Call me when you can. About application fees. Not urgent but want to discuss.*

My stomach tightens. Application fees. The endless, accumulating costs of college applications—$80 per school, multiple schools, plus CSS Profile fees, score sending fees, deposit fees if accepted. My scholarship covers tuition and room at Cambridge Prep, but application season is expensive in ways my parents didn't budget for.

"I should take this," I say, standing. "I'll just be in the hall."

I step outside Study Room 3B, closing the door behind me. The hallway is empty. I call my mother back.

She answers on the first ring. "Hannah, honey. Sorry to bother you during study time."

"It's okay. What's up?"

"Your father and I were going through finances for the college application fees. We have money set aside, but with five schools plus all the additional fees, it's more than we anticipated." Her voice is careful. "We can cover it, but it'll be tight. I wanted to see if there are fee waivers you might qualify for?"

Pride and shame twist together in my chest. "The scholarship covers some. I'll check what waivers are available."

"We don't want you to limit where you apply because of money—"

"I know, Mom. It's fine. I'll figure it out."

"Hannah—"

"Really. I've got it handled." My voice comes out sharper than intended. "The scholarship covers most things. I'll apply for waivers. It'll be fine."

A pause. My mother knows when I'm deflecting.

"Okay, sweetheart. Let us know if you need anything."

"I will. Love you."

"Love you too."

I end the call and stand in the hallway for a minute, composing my expression. Application fees. Just another reminder that I'm navigating financial calculations my wealthy classmates never think about. Jennifer's comment about "people like her" echoes.

I return to Study Room 3B. Ethan is typing on his laptop, but he looks up when I enter.

"Everything okay?"

"Fine." I sit down, pulling my own laptop toward me. "Just parent stuff."

Ethan doesn't push, but something in his expression suggests he heard more than I wanted. The study room door isn't thick. My side of the conversation probably carried.

We work for another thirty minutes in silence. When we pack up at nine, Ethan hesitates.

"Application fee waivers are available through the NACAC," he says quietly. "National Association for College Admission Counseling. Dr. Morrison has information. Most schools accept them."

I freeze, mortified that he heard. "I'm aware."

"I just—thought I'd mention it. In case it helps."

He's trying to be helpful, not pitying, but it still stings. Ethan Wallace, whose family has a library wing named after them, whose application fees are probably less than a rounding error in the Wallace family budget, offering advice on fee waivers.

"Thank you," I say stiffly.

"Hannah—"

"I said thank you." I finish packing my bag. "I'll have my section drafted by Wednesday."

I leave Study Room 3B before he can say anything else. Pride and embarrassment burn in my throat.

Outside, the night is cold and clear. I walk back to Whitman Hall quickly, needing space, needing to not think about Ethan hearing my mother's call about money.

He defended me tonight against Jennifer. Stood up for me in front of witnesses. Shut down her cruelty with precision and cold anger.

But he also heard me navigate the financial calculations he'll never have to make. Saw the gap between scholarship student and legacy family in sharp relief.

We're collaborating. Working together. Maybe even becoming something like allies.

But we're still from different worlds.

And tonight reminded me that no amount of partnership erases that distance.
