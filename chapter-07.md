# Chapter 7: Late Nights and Library Dust

Wednesday evening, and for the first time, I don't arrive at Study Room 3B with dread.

We have a project. A real project, with defined scope and divided responsibilities. Neutral ground where neither of us can claim dominance. It's not perfect, but it's progress.

Ethan arrives at 7:01—almost on time—carrying a proper bag tonight. He actually looks prepared.

"Archives?" he asks.

"Archives," I confirm.

We head to the basement, the narrow staircase feeling slightly less claustrophobic. Mr. Patterson's face lights up when we appear.

"You're back! Wonderful. The Morrison Collection?"

"Yes, please," I say. "We'd like to work with the 1920s correspondence again."

"Excellent." Mr. Patterson leads us to the climate-controlled space, pulling out the same three archival boxes plus two additional ones. "These are from his Yale years—context for his education path. And this one has family letters from before Cambridge Prep. Thought they might be useful."

I feel grateful for his thoughtfulness. "That's perfect. Thank you."

"My pleasure. No one ever uses these collections." He sets out cotton gloves, pencils, and scratch paper. "Same rules—careful handling, no food or drink, photographs allowed. I'll be at the desk."

He leaves us with five boxes of history.

Ethan and I stand on opposite sides of the reading table, surveying the archival boxes between us.

"You take biographical materials, I'll take diplomatic correspondence?" Ethan suggests.

"That was the plan."

We divide the boxes. I pull the two labeled Family Correspondence and Yale Years toward me. Ethan takes the three diplomatic boxes. We put on cotton gloves and begin.

For fifteen minutes, the only sound is paper rustling and quiet camera clicks. I work methodically—pull letter from protective sleeve, photograph front and back, scan contents for relevant information, make brief notes with dates and key details, replace letter carefully.

Across the table, Ethan reads more than photographs. He'll pull a letter, read it entirely, sometimes twice, before photographing. Different approach, but neither better nor worse. Just different.

I find Edward Morrison's acceptance letter to Cambridge Preparatory School, dated March 1915. The formal language can't hide what's underneath—a scholarship offer, full tuition, based on "exceptional academic merit and demonstrated potential despite limited financial means." Edward was fourteen. His father had died two years earlier.

I photograph the letter carefully, moved by a detail I hadn't expected: someone had written in the margin in pencil: *I'm going. I don't care what anyone says. I'm going.*

"Find something interesting?" Ethan asks quietly.

I look up. He's watching me with curiosity, not competition.

"His acceptance letter. He was a scholarship student from age fourteen. After his father died." I hesitate, then add, "He wrote a note to himself in the margin. About going no matter what."

"Can I see?"

I slide my phone across the table so Ethan can view the photograph. He studies it, something shifting in his expression.

"Determination," he says. "Or desperation."

"Maybe both."

"Probably both." Ethan slides the phone back. "I found his first letter from Paris. He was twenty-two, junior attaché, terrified he'd fail. Kept referencing owing his success to 'fortune and others' generosity' rather than his own merit."

Imposter syndrome. In 1923.

"Some things don't change," I say.

"No. They don't."

We return to our research. The silence isn't uncomfortable anymore—it's focused, purposeful. We're both working toward the same goal instead of competing for dominance. It feels strange. Good strange.

At 8:15, Ethan pauses over a letter, frowning. He reads it once, then again, his expression growing more intent.

"Listen to this," he says, and something in his voice makes me stop photographing and look up.

He reads aloud, translating the elegant cursive: "'Tomorrow I present our position to the French delegation. The weight of representation sits heavily tonight. What if I fail? What if my words, my arguments, my very presence proves insufficient to the task? I find myself unable to sleep, walking the embassy halls, reminding myself that I have prepared, that I have studied, that I know the material. But knowledge and performance are different beasts, and the latter has always terrified me more than I admit to anyone.'"

Ethan's voice is careful, controlled, but something underneath isn't. Something personal.

"He had anxiety," I say quietly.

"Severe anxiety, from the sound of it." Ethan continues reading: "'My colleagues sleep soundly, confident in their family names and connections. They were raised knowing they belonged in these rooms. I was raised knowing I had to prove I belonged, again and again, with no mistakes permitted. The scholarship boy from nowhere doesn't get the luxury of failure.'"

The archives room is very quiet. Just old paper and dust and the hum of climate control.

"He writes like he thought failing once would erase everything he'd achieved," Ethan says, still looking at the letter.

"Because it probably would have. For him." I recognize that fear intimately. One mistake, one slip, and the scholarship student's place at the table vanishes. "The pressure to be perfect when you're succeeding despite expectations, not because of them."

"Yeah." Ethan sets the letter down carefully. "He writes about it a lot, actually. The performance anxiety. The sense that his success was always temporary, always dependent on not making mistakes."

I watch Ethan across the table. The careful way he's not making eye contact. The tension in his shoulders. The slight tremor in his hands that he hides by putting them flat on the table.

He's not just reading about someone else's anxiety.

The moment stretches. I could let it pass, return to research, maintain our careful professional distance. That would be safer.

But Monday, we nearly collided in the doorway and saw each other's exhaustion. Tonight, Ethan is reading a hundred-year-old letter about anxiety like it's a mirror.

"Does it feel familiar?" I ask quietly.

Ethan looks up, startled. For three seconds, he's completely unguarded—vulnerable in a way I've never seen.

Then the walls come back up. Not hostile, just... careful.

"I'm not discussing my personal life."

"I'm not asking you to. I'm asking if the research resonates."

"Why does that matter?"

"Because the best research comes from personal connection. Understanding why a topic matters to you makes the analysis deeper."

It's true, but it's also an olive branch. Permission to acknowledge what we're both carefully not saying.

Ethan studies me for a long moment. Then, carefully: "Yes. It feels familiar. The performance pressure. The sense that you have to be perfect because there's no safety net."

"Legacy expectations," I say. Not a question.

"Among other things."

I could push. Ask about the "other things." But that would be invasive, and we're not there yet. Maybe we'll never be there. But this—this small admission—is more than we've shared in three years of rivalry.

"For what it's worth," I say, "Morrison ended up as a successful ambassador. The anxiety didn't stop him."

"No. But it made everything harder than it looked from outside."

Like Ethan's effortless genius facade. The performance that costs him more than anyone sees.

"Yeah," I agree. "It probably did."

We go back to work, but something's shifted. We're not just researching Edward Morrison's life anymore. We're finding parts of ourselves in his story—different parts, different struggles, but the same fundamental pressure to prove worth through perfect performance.

At nine o'clock, Mr. Patterson appears to announce closing time. We've photographed forty-seven letters, filled six pages of notes, and established clear parallel research tracks. It's the most productive session we've had.

Outside the library, the October night is cold and clear. Campus is quiet—most students already back in dorms or at the student union. Ethan and I walk across the quad together, no particular hurry to split toward separate dorms.

"Can I ask you something?" I say, then immediately regret it because I'm not sure what I actually want to ask.

"You just did."

"Smartass."

The corner of Ethan's mouth twitches in almost-smile. "What's your question?"

"Do you think pressure was different in the 1920s? Morrison's generation versus ours?"

Ethan considers this as we walk. Our breath mists in the cold air. Somewhere across campus, music drifts from an open dorm window.

"I don't think pressure ever really changes," he says finally. "The targets change—different expectations, different measures of success—but the weight feels the same. Morrison had to prove himself worthy of a scholarship spot and diplomatic position. We have to prove ourselves worthy of Ivy League acceptances and future success. The pressure to perform, to be perfect, to justify our place—that's probably constant across generations."

"That's depressing."

"Or comforting. Means we're not uniquely screwed up. Just ordinarily screwed up like everyone who came before."

I laugh, surprised. "That's the most optimistic thing I've ever heard you say."

"Don't get used to it. I'm usually much more cynical."

We've reached the path split—Thoreau Hall to the right, Whitman to the left. We stop, neither immediately moving to separate.

"Monday's session?" I ask.

"Same time. We should probably start outlining our research sections soon. Make sure they'll connect coherently."

"That's very organized of you."

"I'm capable of planning when the project actually makes sense."

"High praise from someone who showed up to our first session with one notebook."

"I showed up with ideas and openness to collaboration. You showed up with a typed agenda you made without asking my input."

We're smiling slightly as we argue. When did that happen?

"Friday went badly, Monday went better, Wednesday was actually productive," I say.

"Progress."

"Don't let it go to your head."

"Wouldn't dream of it." Ethan shifts his bag on his shoulder. "Good night, Hannah."

It's the first time he's said my name outside of arguments or formal situations. Just... my name. Neutral. Maybe even friendly.

"Good night, Ethan."

We walk to our separate dorms. I don't look back, but I wonder if he does.

In my room, I transfer the forty-seven photographed letters to my laptop and start organizing them chronologically. As I work, I keep coming back to the letter Ethan read aloud. Morrison's anxiety, his fear of failure, his sense that perfection was the only option.

*The scholarship boy from nowhere doesn't get the luxury of failure.*

I understand that bone-deep.

Does Ethan understand the legacy pressure the same way? The weight of family names and expectations?

Probably.

We're rivals. Competitors for the same goals. But maybe we're also the only two people at Cambridge Prep who truly understand what the other is carrying.

That doesn't make us friends.

But maybe it makes us less alone.
