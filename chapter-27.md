# Chapter 27: The Speech

*[Note: This chapter contains the full valedictorian speech given at graduation, expanding on the Senior Awards Night preview]*

Graduation day arrived with perfect June weather—sunny and warm but not too hot, with a breeze that made Cambridge Prep's banners flutter against blue sky. White folding chairs covered the quad in neat rows facing a temporary stage. Faculty in academic regalia sat to the left. The senior class, in caps and gowns, sat to the right. Families filled the center section, cameras ready.

I sat in the front row of seniors, valedictorian position, with my speech notes folded in my lap. Ethan sat beside me as salutatorian. Under our graduation gowns, we were holding hands.

"Nervous?" he whispered.

"Terrified."

"You'll be amazing."

"How do you know?"

"Because I've watched you be amazing for seven months straight. This is just one more thing."

The ceremony proceeded with traditional formality. Dr. Morrison welcomed families. The headmaster gave opening remarks about the Class of [year]'s achievements. Professor Brennan presented academic awards. Then Dr. Morrison returned to the podium.

"It is my honor to introduce our valedictorian, Hannah Price."

I stood, legs shaking, and walked to the podium. My parents were in the third row—my mother already crying, my father beaming with pride. Ethan's family sat nearby, his mother smiling encouragingly.

I unfolded my speech notes, took a breath, and began.

"Headmaster Williams, Dr. Morrison, faculty, families, and fellow graduates:

"When I arrived at Cambridge Prep four years ago, I brought a suitcase full of clothes, a calculator that had seen better days, and an enormous chip on my shoulder. I was the scholarship student from Worcester about to compete against students whose families had attended elite prep schools for generations. I didn't know if I belonged here. So I decided to prove I did—with perfect grades, perfect test scores, and perfect everything.

"I thought perfection would prove I deserved my scholarship. That if I could just be valedictorian, stand here giving this speech, I'd finally feel like I belonged.

"I was wrong about almost all of that."

A ripple of attention moved through the audience.

"Don't misunderstand—I'm grateful to stand here as valedictorian. Grateful to my teachers who challenged me, my family who sacrificed for me, and my classmates who pushed me to be better. But the lesson Cambridge Prep really taught me wasn't about being perfect. It was about being human.

"This fall, Dr. Morrison did something I thought was cruel. She mandated that my academic rival and I spend six weeks collaborating. Ethan Wallace and I had been competing for the top spot since freshman year. We were tied for first in the class, applying to the same colleges, locked in what felt like an essential competition. The last thing I wanted was forced partnership with the person I needed to beat.

"I showed up to our first mandated study session furious. I had a prepared agenda, color-coded notes, and a plan to get through the requirement while maintaining competitive edge. Ethan had one notebook and zero patience for my organizational system."

Laughter rippled through the crowd. In the front row, Ethan was grinning.

"Those early sessions were—to put it mildly—contentious. We argued about research methodologies. We competed over who could solve calculus problems faster. We even argued about *Wuthering Heights* symbolism, which I maintain I won."

More laughter. Ethan shook his head, still smiling.

"But something shifted. Slowly, reluctantly, we stopped competing and started collaborating. We made each other's work better. We challenged and supported simultaneously. The rivalry that had defined us transformed into partnership.

"And I learned something that four years of perfect grades hadn't taught me: competition without respect is meaningless. Being first matters less than being connected. The perfect score isn't the grade—it's finding people who make you better while accepting you exactly as you are."

I paused, looking out at my classmates.

"Graduating class, we've spent four years measuring ourselves by grades and test scores and college acceptances. Those things matter. But they're not what we'll remember about Cambridge Prep twenty years from now.

"We'll remember late-night study sessions where we actually helped each other instead of competing. We'll remember teachers who cared about our growth, not just our GPAs. We'll remember friendships that survived academic pressure. We'll remember the moments we chose connection over competition.

"I'll remember Study Room 3B in Wellington Library, where Dr. Morrison's forced collaboration taught me that the person challenging you hardest might also become the person who understands you best. Where rivalry transformed into partnership. Where I learned that losing to someone you love teaches more than winning alone ever could."

My mother was crying openly now. Several other parents had tissues out.

"Some of you are heading to Ivy League schools. Others to state universities, art programs, athletic careers, or gap years to figure things out. We'll measure success differently—some by degrees, some by impact, some by happiness, some by wealth. But I hope we all remember that success means less when you achieve it alone.

"The night I got my Princeton acceptance letter—the goal I'd worked toward for four years—I couldn't celebrate. Because the person I cared about most had been deferred. And I realized in that moment that his happiness mattered more to me than my achievement. That's when I knew: the perfect score isn't the prize you win. It's the people you find along the way."

I looked directly at Ethan.

"So thank you, Ethan Wallace, for three years of competition that made me sharper and seven months of partnership that made me better. Thank you for challenging every assumption I had about rivals and relationships. Thank you for making me believe I belonged here not through perfect grades but through genuine connection.

"And thank you to everyone who made Cambridge Prep feel less like competition and more like community. To Sarah McKenzie, who put up with my stress and celebrated my victories. To Professor Brennan, who valued genuine learning over grade-grubbing. To Dr. Morrison, whose forced collaboration changed everything. To my parents, who sacrificed so I could be here."

I took a breath for the closing.

"Class of [year], we're leaving Cambridge Prep for futures we can't fully imagine. We'll face challenges we're not prepared for. We'll compete for jobs, promotions, recognition. But I hope we remember what matters most: the people beside us in the competition. The ones who challenge us to be better. The ones who support us when we struggle. The ones who remind us that winning means nothing if we're celebrating alone.

"The perfect score isn't perfection. It's partnership. It's finding someone who makes you better while accepting you exactly as you are. It's choosing connection over competition. It's being brave enough to let people in.

"Congratulations, Cambridge Prep Class of [year]. May we all find our perfect score—whatever form it takes.

"Thank you."

The applause started immediately—thunderous, sustained. I stepped away from the podium on shaking legs and returned to my seat. Ethan squeezed my hand under our graduation gowns.

"Perfect," he whispered.

"Biased," I whispered back.

"Perfect and biased."

The ceremony continued with diploma distribution, but I barely registered it. My speech was done. The four-year journey culminating in this moment was complete.

When they called "Hannah Marie Price," I walked across the stage to receive my diploma from Headmaster Williams. My parents cheered loudly enough to be embarrassing. I didn't care.

When they called "Ethan Christopher Wallace," I cheered just as loudly.

After the ceremony, families swarmed the quad for photos. My parents pulled me into hugs, telling me how proud they were, how beautiful the speech was, how grown up I seemed.

Ethan's mother found me in the crowd. "Your speech was wonderful, Hannah. Truly."

"Thank you, Mrs. Wallace."

"Catherine, please." She smiled. "I'm glad Ethan found you. He's happier than I've seen him in years."

Ethan appeared with his father, who looked less stern than usual.

"Congratulations, Miss Price," Mr. Wallace said formally. "That was an... unconventional speech."

"Thank you, sir."

"But effective. You made your point clearly." Which, coming from Richard Wallace, was probably high praise.

My parents joined us, and the two families stood together taking photos—working-class Worcester meeting Connecticut old money, united by their children's achievement and relationship.

"Princeton in the fall?" my father asked Ethan.

"Yes, sir. Got off the waitlist in April."

"So you'll both be there."

"Yes," Ethan and I said simultaneously, then smiled at each other.

Later, after families had left and the quad was being cleared, Ethan and I found ourselves back at Wellington Library. Study Room 3B was unlocked.

We went inside—the room that had transformed us from rivals to partners to more. Our table. Our chairs. Our space.

"We did it," I said.

"We did." Ethan pulled me close. "Four years of Cambridge Prep. Valedictorian and salutatorian. Both heading to Princeton. Together."

"Together," I agreed.

"Thank you for the speech. For being brave enough to say all that in front of everyone."

"You made me brave."

"No. You were always brave. I just helped you see it."

We stood in Study Room 3B, in our graduation gowns, holding each other and looking out the window at the quad where our entire class was celebrating.

"Ready for Princeton?" Ethan asked.

"Ready for anything, as long as you're there."

"Cheesy, Price."

"But true, Wallace."

He kissed me, and it felt like an ending and a beginning simultaneously. The end of Cambridge Prep. The beginning of whatever came next.

Together.

Always together.

The perfect score.
