# Chapter 29: Study Room 3B, Revisited

The library was closed for graduation day, but Mr. Patterson—the night librarian who'd watched Ethan and me study through countless late sessions—had left the side door unlocked with a knowing smile.

We climbed the stairs to the second floor, walked down the familiar hallway, and pushed open the door to Study Room 3B one last time.

The room looked exactly the same. The long wooden table with scratches from years of students. The uncomfortable chairs that promoted studying over socializing. The window overlooking the quad. The door with its small window that had made this space feel simultaneously private and appropriate.

I sat in my usual chair. Ethan sat in his. The table between us felt loaded with significance.

"Remember the first time we met here?" I asked, running my hand along the worn wooden surface of the table.

"You had a color-coded agenda, three different highlighters, and a typed outline of how we should divide the research work."

"You showed up late with one notebook, zero plan, and what I considered a completely unacceptable casual attitude toward academic collaboration."

"And we immediately started arguing about how to structure the research project. You wanted everything predetermined. I wanted to figure it out as we went."

"You wanted flexibility. I wanted clear deadlines and division of labor. We were fundamentally incompatible as partners."

"We couldn't agree on anything," Ethan said, smiling at the memory. "I genuinely thought those six weeks were going to be absolute torture. Dr. Morrison forcing me to work with my rival felt like academic punishment."

"They were torture. For about the first two sessions. Then something shifted."

"Yeah. We started actually listening instead of just waiting for our turn to argue."

"Then what?"

I thought about it. "Then we started actually listening to each other instead of just competing. You made a joke about Professor Brennan's obsession with symbolism, and I laughed, and suddenly you weren't just my rival anymore. You were a person."

"When did you stop seeing me as the enemy?"

"Probably that night we stayed late working on the research paper. When you talked about your anxiety and panic attacks like they were just facts, not shameful secrets. You were so honest about struggling, and I'd spent three years pretending I never struggled with anything." I met his eyes across the table. "That's when I realized you weren't my competition. You were my mirror. Showing me all the things I was afraid to admit about myself."

Ethan stood and walked around the table to my side, just like he had the night we'd confessed our feelings. "When did I stop seeing you as competition?"

"I don't know. When?"

"The night you told me I belonged at Cambridge Prep. After midterms, walking back from the library at midnight. You said I'd earned everything I had, that my application wasn't weaker because I had privilege." He sat beside me. "No one had ever validated my struggles before. My father expects effortless excellence. My classmates assume everything comes easily. But you saw through the performance and acknowledged that it was hard for me too."

"Because I understood."

"Exactly. You understood in a way no one else did. And I realized I didn't want to beat you. I wanted to be with you."

I leaned my head on his shoulder. "This room changed everything."

"Dr. Morrison's evil plan worked perfectly."

"She definitely knew what she was doing."

We sat in comfortable silence, absorbing the weight of everything that had happened in Study Room 3B. Eighteen mandatory sessions. Countless voluntary ones. Arguments about Heathcliff. Late-night cramming for midterms. College application reviews. The research paper that Professor Brennan had praised. Confession of feelings. First kiss.

All here, in this small room with its uncomfortable chairs and fluorescent lighting.

"What do you think we would have been like if Dr. Morrison hadn't forced us together?" I asked.

"Still rivals, probably. Still competing for valedictorian. Maybe you still would have won by three hundredths of a point, but we would have celebrated or mourned separately instead of together."

"We would have gone to different colleges."

"Princeton and Yale. Close but not the same. We might have run into each other at some inter-Ivy event and made polite conversation about how Cambridge Prep prepared us well."

"Terrible alternative timeline."

"The worst." Ethan wrapped his arm around me. "But that's not what happened. Dr. Morrison forced us into this room, and we transformed each other."

"You made me less afraid."

"Of what?"

"Of admitting I needed help. Of being imperfect. Of letting someone see the parts of me that weren't polished and perfect." I turned to look at him. "Three years I spent trying to prove I deserved my scholarship through flawless performance. You made me realize I deserved it just by being me."

"You made me braver too. About honesty. About vulnerability. About admitting when things were hard instead of pretending they were effortless." He touched my face gently. "You saw the real me—anxiety and all—and didn't think less of me for it."

"How could I think less of you? You were perfect."

"I was performing perfect. There's a difference."

"I know. I was performing too." I smiled. "We were both such disasters."

"The most accomplished disasters Cambridge Prep has ever produced."

"Valedictorian and salutatorian disasters."

"The best kind."

Outside the window, the sun was setting—golden light streaming across the quad where our classmates were celebrating. Tomorrow we'd all scatter to different futures. But tonight, we were still here. Still students. Still ours.

"I'm going to miss this place," I said quietly.

"The room?"

"The room. The library. Cambridge Prep. All of it."

"Me too." Ethan pulled me closer. "But we're taking the important part with us."

"What part?"

"This." He gestured between us. "What we built here. The partnership. The understanding. The love."

"You can't pack that in a suitcase."

"No, but you can carry it with you. To Princeton. To wherever we go after that. To everything that comes next."

I thought about that. Four years at Cambridge Prep, all leading to this moment in Study Room 3B. All leading to understanding that the perfect score wasn't the grade or the rank. It was finding someone who made you better while accepting you exactly as you were.

"Read me something," I said suddenly.

"What?"

"From your AP Lit anthology. Like we used to during study sessions. One more time in this room."

Ethan smiled and pulled his phone out, finding a poem he'd saved. He read:

*"Let me not to the marriage of true minds*
*Admit impediments. Love is not love*
*Which alters when it alteration finds,*
*Or bends with the remover to remove."*

Shakespeare. Sonnet 116. About love that doesn't change with circumstances. About partnership that survives challenges.

"That's us," I said.

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. The marriage of true minds. Two people who compete and collaborate and challenge each other. Who don't let distance or different colleges or any impediment stop them."

"No impediments," Ethan agreed. "Just us, figuring it out together."

He kissed me there in Study Room 3B one final time—soft and sweet and full of promise. When we pulled apart, we were both smiling.

"Ready to leave?" he asked.

"Not really. But also yes."

"That's college in a nutshell."

We stood, taking one last look around Study Room 3B. Our table. Our chairs. Our space. The room where rivals became partners became more.

"Thank you," I said to the empty room. "For everything."

Ethan took my hand. "Come on. Our future is waiting."

We walked out of Study Room 3B, down the library stairs, out into the June evening where the graduation celebration was still happening on the quad.

Behind us, the library stood silent—full of books and knowledge and the memory of two students who'd learned that sometimes the best things come from requirements you initially resist.

Ahead of us, Princeton waited. And everything that came after.

Together.

Always together.

The perfect score.
