# Chapter 16: Midterm Crisis

Wednesday evening found Study Room 3B transformed into what looked like the aftermath of an academic explosion. Textbooks sprawled across the wooden table in overlapping layers, note cards formed precarious towers at both ends, and candy bar wrappers littered the spaces between our laptops. The November darkness pressed against the window, turning the glass into a black mirror that reflected the fluorescent lights overhead.

"Okay, quiz me on *The Great Gatsby*," Ethan said, rubbing his eyes. "I know Brennan's going to put symbolism on the midterm."

I flipped through my color-coded note cards. "The green light."

"Gatsby's yearning for the unattainable American Dream. Distance between aspiration and reality." He paused. "Or, as Brennan would say, 'the failure of the American spiritual landscape to provide meaning in an age of materialism.'"

I laughed despite my exhaustion. "You sound exactly like him."

"Three years of practice." Ethan reached for the bag of M&Ms from the vending machine. "Your turn. Calculus. Derivative of sine x?"

"Cosine x." I grabbed my own handful. "This is actually working."

"You sound surprised."

"I am surprised." I gestured at the chaos of our study materials. "I usually study alone. I didn't think collaborative cramming could be efficient."

Ethan looked at me over the top of his AP Lit anthology. "Hannah, we've been studying together three times a week for almost two months now. At what point does it stop being surprising that we work well together?"

The question landed with more weight than he probably intended. He was right—we did work well together. Better than I worked with anyone else, maybe better than I worked alone. The realization should have been reassuring, but instead it made my chest feel tight in a way that had nothing to do with midterm stress.

"Fair point," I said, keeping my voice light. "What time is it?"

Ethan checked his watch. "Nine forty-five."

"We were supposed to end at nine."

"Yeah, well." He shrugged. "Midterms and college application deadlines decided to collide this week. I figured we were both going to be here late anyway."

He was right about that too. I'd blocked out midnight in my planner for extra study time. The fact that I was spending it with Ethan instead of alone in my dorm room was—

I cut off that thought before it could complete itself.

"Chemistry," I said instead. "Acid-base neutralization reactions."

We quizzed each other until the library's closing announcement crackled through the ancient intercom system. "The Wellington Library will be closing in fifteen minutes. Please gather your belongings and proceed to the exits. The library will reopen tomorrow at seven AM."

We packed up our materials quickly—Ethan handling papers while I organized books. The library was nearly empty as we headed downstairs.

Outside, the November cold hit like a physical force. I'd forgotten my heavier coat—again—and the cardigan I'd grabbed that morning provided approximately zero defense against temperatures that had dropped into the thirties. My breath formed pale clouds in the air as we crossed the quad toward the residence halls.

The campus looked different at midnight. The brick pathways were empty of the usual rush of students between classes. The old colonial buildings stood dark except for scattered windows where other insomniacs were still awake. Above us, stars were actually visible despite the security lights—sharp and clear in the cold November sky.

"I had a panic attack yesterday," Ethan said abruptly.

I stopped walking. We were halfway across the quad, equidistant from the library and the dorms, standing under one of the old oak trees that formed a canopy over the walkway even now that their leaves had fallen.

"Before the calculus exam," he continued, not looking at me. His hands were shoved deep in his coat pockets. "Ryan found me in our room barely breathing. Took me twenty minutes to calm down enough to make it to Hamilton Hall."

"Did you—" I hesitated. "Did you still take the exam?"

"Yeah. Got there ten minutes late, but Brennan didn't dock me for it." Ethan finally looked at me. "I aced it, by the way. Ninety-eight percent. Which is objectively insane given that I spent the time I should have been reviewing derivatives hyperventilating on my dorm room floor."

The matter-of-fact way he said it made my throat tight. "What helps? When that happens?"

"Medication helps prevent most of them. But in the moment?" He tilted his head back, looking up at the bare tree branches silhouetted against the dark sky. "I have to remind myself that grades aren't actually life or death, even when they feel that way. That one test won't determine my entire future. That my worth as a person isn't measured in percentages and decimal points."

"Does that work?"

"Eventually. Sometimes it takes a while for my brain to believe what I'm telling it." He lowered his gaze back to me. "You get it, though. The feeling that everything's riding on every single assignment."

It wasn't a question, but I answered anyway. "I think if I fail here—at Cambridge Prep, at maintaining this GPA—then I fail my family's sacrifice. My parents are working extra shifts so I can be here. My mom took on weekend work at the diner. My dad does overtime at the plant. And I got this incredible scholarship, this opportunity that most kids from Worcester will never have, and if I don't succeed it means I never deserved it in the first place."

The words came out in a rush, things I'd never said aloud before. Not to Sarah, not to my parents, certainly not to any of the other students who seemed to carry their achievements so lightly.

"That's not how failure works," Ethan said quietly.

"What do you mean?"

"Failure doesn't retroactively erase what you've already achieved. You earned your spot here, Hannah. You earned your GPA. You earned your perfect test scores and your scholarship. If you got a B on a calculus test—which you won't, by the way, because you're brilliant at calculus—it wouldn't mean you never deserved to be at Cambridge Prep. It would just mean you had an off day on one test."

I wrapped my arms around myself against the cold. "You say that like it's obvious."

"It should be obvious. To you especially." He took a step closer. We were standing under the oak tree, visible breath mingling in the small space between us. "You're the hardest working person I've ever met. You don't take anything for granted. You've earned everything you have, and one bad grade wouldn't change that. It wouldn't prove you don't belong here. Nothing could prove that, because you do belong here."

The kindness in his voice undid something in my chest. For three years, I'd carried the weight of proving myself, of justifying my presence among students whose families had attended elite schools for generations. Ethan came from exactly that kind of family—the Wallaces had a library wing named after them, for crying out loud—but he was telling me I belonged.

"That's the nicest thing anyone's said to me in three years," I said, and my voice came out rough.

"Then people haven't been paying attention."

We stood there under the oak tree, neither of us moving. The cold had turned my fingers numb inside my cardigan sleeves, but I didn't want to break this moment by suggesting we keep walking. The conversation had shifted into territory that felt important, fragile, like something that could shatter if we acknowledged it too directly.

"We should probably go inside," Ethan finally said. "You're freezing."

I was freezing. I'd been shivering for the past five minutes. But the cold felt distant compared to the warmth spreading through my chest from his words.

"Yeah," I agreed.

We started walking again, our footsteps falling into an easy rhythm on the brick pathway. The residence halls were close now—Whitman on the left for the girls, Thoreau on the right for the boys. Usually this was where we split up, calling quick goodnights before heading to our separate dorms.

Tonight, we both slowed as we reached the fork in the path.

"Same time Friday?" Ethan asked.

"Unless we both collapse from exhaustion first."

"There's a non-zero chance of that happening." He smiled, and the expression transformed his whole face. Without the careful control he usually maintained, he looked younger. Less burdened. "Good night, Hannah."

"Good night."

I watched him walk toward Thoreau Hall, hands still in his pockets, shoulders slightly hunched against the cold. Then I turned toward Whitman, my thoughts spinning.

Sarah was still awake when I slipped into our room. She looked up from her history textbook and raised her eyebrows. "You're smiling."

"I'm allowed to smile."

"After five hours of studying for midterms?" Sarah closed her textbook. "This is about Ethan."

"We were just studying. And talking."

"About what?"

"Calculus derivatives. *Great Gatsby* symbolism. Panic attacks and pressure and how grades aren't actually life or death." The words tumbled out.

Sarah was quiet for a moment. "That's not normal study session stuff, Hannah."

I knew that. I'd known it standing under the oak tree, watching my breath mingle with Ethan's in the November cold.

"It's complicated," I said finally.

"Most things worth having are."

I thought about that as I got ready for bed, as I set my alarm for six AM to fit in final review before my first midterm. Sarah turned out her light and was asleep within minutes, but I lay awake in the darkness, watching shadows shift across the ceiling.

Two months ago, Ethan Wallace had been the name at the top of the class rank list beside mine. My rival. The person preventing me from achieving what I'd worked for since freshman year.

Now he was the person who made Study Room 3B feel like the safest place on campus. The person who understood pressure and anxiety and the weight of other people's expectations. The person who'd told me I belonged here and made me believe it.

We'd crossed from rivals to something more complicated. Maybe friends. Maybe—

I cut off that thought the same way I'd cut it off earlier in the library.

But lying alone in my dorm room with Friday's study session already marked in my planner, I couldn't quite convince myself that "complicated" was the right word for what was happening between Ethan Wallace and me.

Inevitable, maybe.

Terrifying, definitely.

But not complicated.

Not anymore.
