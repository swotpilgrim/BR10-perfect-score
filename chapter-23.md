# Chapter 23: The Announcement

Mid-January brought the kind of cold that made even the shortest walk across campus feel like an Arctic expedition. It also brought the academic honors assembly where Dr. Morrison would announce valedictorian and salutatorian.

I sat with Sarah in Ashford Hall, trying to appear calm while my stomach did complicated gymnastics. Across the room, Ethan sat with Ryan. We'd both known this announcement was coming—the final class rankings after fall semester grades had been calculated. The difference between first and second place came down to hundredths of a grade point accumulated over four years.

"You're going to win," Sarah whispered. "You've had perfect grades since freshman year."

"So has Ethan."

"But you've taken harder classes. More APs, more honors sections."

"He's taken the same classes."

Sarah squeezed my hand. "Either way, you've both earned it. Try to remember that."

Dr. Morrison took the podium at the front of Ashford Hall, and the senior class quieted. Faculty lined the sides of the room—Professor Brennan, the calculus teacher, the history department chair. All watching to see who'd won the four-year academic battle.

"Good morning, seniors," Dr. Morrison began. "We're here today to recognize academic excellence and announce leadership positions for graduation. As you know, Cambridge Prep has a long tradition of honoring our top students."

My hands were sweating. I folded them in my lap so no one would see them shaking.

"This year's valedictorian race was the closest in Cambridge Prep history," Dr. Morrison continued. "We've had competitive years before, but never have two students maintained such identical excellence across four full years. The difference between our top two students—" She paused for emphasis. "—is three hundredths of a grade point."

The room murmured. Three hundredths. Barely anything. The difference of a single quiz question over four years.

"It is my honor to announce that this year's valedictorian is Hannah Price."

The room erupted in applause. Students turned to look at me. Faculty nodded approvingly. Sarah hugged me while I sat frozen, unable to process what I'd just heard.

I'd won. After four years, I'd actually won.

But I couldn't celebrate until I knew—

"And our salutatorian is Ethan Wallace," Dr. Morrison continued.

More applause. I immediately looked for Ethan across the room. He was clapping, smiling at me genuinely, no trace of resentment visible on his face. Our eyes met, and he nodded once. Congratulations.

The assembly continued with other announcements—National Merit Scholars, college athletic commitments, academic team victories. But I barely heard any of it. All I could think about was that hundredths-of-a-point difference. How close it had been. How easily it could have gone the other way.

After the assembly, students clustered in groups, congratulating winners and commiserating with those who'd hoped for different results. Jennifer Campbell appeared beside me, smile sharp.

"Congratulations, Hannah. That must be such a relief. I know how much you needed this."

The implication was clear: scholarship student desperate for validation. I forced a smile. "Thank you, Jennifer."

"Three hundredths of a point. So close. Ethan must be devastated."

"He seems fine."

"He's good at hiding disappointment. Wallace family training." She adjusted her bag. "Well, enjoy your speech. I'm sure it will be very..." She paused, searching for a word. "Earnest."

She walked away before I could respond. Sarah materialized at my elbow.

"Ignore her. She's been third in the class for four years and can't handle it."

"I know." But Jennifer's words stuck anyway. Ethan must be devastated.

I searched the crowd for him, finally spotting him outside the hall talking to Ryan. I pushed through the clusters of students and approached hesitantly.

"Hey," I said.

Ethan turned, and his smile was genuine. "Hey, valedictorian."

"Ethan, I—"

Before I could finish, he pulled me into a hug. It was brief but warm, and when he pulled back, his hands lingered on my shoulders.

"Congratulations," he said. "You earned this. Four years of perfect work. You deserve valedictorian."

"Three hundredths of a point. That's nothing."

"It's enough. And it's fair." He dropped his hands. "I'm genuinely happy for you, Hannah."

"You're not disappointed?"

"Honestly?" He glanced at Ryan, who took the hint and wandered off. "I'm relieved."

"What?"

"Come on." Ethan gestured toward the quad. We walked away from the crowd, finding relative privacy by the old oak tree.

"I'm relieved," he repeated. "Losing valedictorian to you doesn't hurt the way I thought it would. Because you're right—three hundredths is nothing. We're basically tied. And after spending the past few months working together instead of competing, the whole rivalry seems..." He searched for the word. "Insignificant."

"That's what I wanted for three years."

"I know. And I wanted it too. But now?" He shook his head. "Now I'm just glad I don't have to write the valedictorian speech. That's terrifying."

I laughed despite the situation. "Oh God. I have to write a speech."

"You'll be great at it. You're better with words than I am anyway."

We stood under the oak tree, breath forming clouds in the January cold. Other students were heading back to classes, the assembly officially over. But neither Ethan nor I moved.

"Are you really okay?" I asked quietly.

"I really am. Losing to you taught me more than winning would have. It taught me that the person pushing me hardest could also be the person who supports me most. That competition without respect is empty, but partnership makes everything better." He met my eyes. "I wouldn't trade these past few months for valedictorian. Not even close."

My throat felt tight. "You're making it very hard not to hug you again."

"Then don't resist." He opened his arms.

I stepped into the hug, and this time it wasn't brief. It was the kind of hug that said everything we weren't quite ready to say out loud. When we finally pulled apart, I was smiling.

"I have to get to calculus," Ethan said reluctantly.

"And I have to process that I have to write a speech."

"If you want help, you know where to find me."

"Study Room 3B, seven PM?"

"Always."

I watched him head toward Hamilton Hall before turning back to my own dorm. The enormity of it was starting to sink in. Valedictorian. Three hundred twenty students in our class, and I'd finished first. Everything my family had sacrificed, every late night studying, every perfect grade—it had led to this.

But the moment that mattered most had been under the oak tree, with Ethan telling me he was genuinely happy for me. Telling me partnership mattered more than winning.

That night, I sat in Study Room 3B with my laptop open to a blank document titled "Valedictorian Speech." Ethan sat across from me, working on his own homework but available for consultation.

"What do I even say?" I asked. "Thanks for the memories, don't do drugs, go Tigers?"

"Please don't say any of that."

"Then what?"

Ethan closed his chemistry textbook. "What did you actually learn here? Not the official stuff—the real lessons."

I thought about it. "That competition without connection is meaningless. That being the best means nothing if you're alone at the top. That the person who challenged me most became the person who understood me best."

"So say that."

"I can't give a speech about you."

"Why not?" He leaned forward. "Hannah, everyone at this school has watched us be rivals for four years. They saw us forced into collaboration. They saw us stop competing and start partnering. That's actually interesting. That means something. It's better than generic graduation platitudes."

"It feels too personal."

"The best speeches always are."

I stared at my blank document, then started typing. Not the safe, generic speech I'd been planning. Something honest. Something that mattered.

An hour later, I had a rough draft. Ethan read it, made suggestions, helped me cut the parts that were too sentimental and strengthen the parts that resonated.

"This is good," he said finally. "Really good. You're going to make people cry."

"That's not the goal."

"It's not not the goal."

We worked until nine PM, when the library announced closing. Packing up our materials, Ethan said, "You know what's funny?"

"What?"

"Six months ago, if someone had told me I'd be helping you write your valedictorian speech after losing to you by three hundredths of a point, I would have said they were insane."

"Six months ago, I would have said the same."

"But here we are."

"Here we are," I agreed.

We walked across the frozen quad together, our regular route back to the dorms. At the fork in the path, we both hesitated.

"Thank you," I said. "For being so gracious about this. For helping with the speech. For being you."

"Thank you for making losing feel less like losing and more like... I don't know. Growing, maybe."

"Growing?"

"I learned more from coming in second to you than I would have from winning. That has to count for something."

I thought about that as I headed back to Whitman Hall. About how winning had felt hollow until Ethan congratulated me. About how the speech I was actually proud of wasn't the safe one celebrating generic achievement but the honest one about partnership and growth.

About how the perfect score wasn't the grade or the rank.

It was finding someone who made you better while accepting you exactly as you were.

And I'd found that.

Even if I hadn't quite figured out how to tell him yet.
