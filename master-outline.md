# MASTER OUTLINE: The Perfect Score

## Chapter 1: The Weight of Perfect

Hannah Price walks through Cambridge Preparatory's quad on the first day of senior year, carrying the weight of three years of perfect grades. She's president of three clubs, maintains a 4.0 GPA, and knows exactly which colleges she's applying to—Princeton first choice, Yale and Columbia as backups. In Dr. Morrison's mandatory senior meeting, Hannah receives her current class rank: tied for first with Ethan Wallace, her rival since freshman year. The counselor mentions that both are applying to identical schools, which sends a chill through Hannah. In the dining hall that evening, Hannah sits with her Academic Bowl team while Ethan sits with the legacy students across the room. Sarah, her roommate, teases her about the rivalry being unhealthy. Hannah spots Ethan watching her and turns away. The chapter ends with Hannah in her single dorm room, planning her semester schedule down to fifteen-minute increments, determined that senior year will be when she finally beats Ethan Wallace for good.

## Chapter 2: Effortless Excellence

Ethan Wallace sits in his dorm room in Thoreau Hall, staring at his class schedule and feeling the familiar tightness in his chest. His roommate Ryan returns from soccer practice, cheerful and relaxed—everything Ethan isn't. In their first AP Literature class with Professor Brennan, Ethan watches Hannah take meticulous notes while he tries to look casually engaged despite having read the assigned book twice over the summer. After class, students cluster around the college acceptance board showing last year's results. Jennifer Campbell makes a pointed comment about how scholarship students must feel extra pressure, clearly aimed at Hannah. Ethan surprises himself by defending Hannah's work ethic, earning a sharp look from her. In the evening, Ethan attends Academic Decathlon practice where he's supposed to be team captain but feels disconnected. He returns to his room and takes his anxiety medication while Ryan is in the shower, hiding the bottle quickly. The chapter ends with Ethan realizing he's exhausted from pretending success comes easily.

## Chapter 3: The Summons

Three weeks into the semester, both Hannah and Ethan receive identical notes in their campus mailboxes: mandatory meeting with Dr. Morrison. Hannah panics, wondering if her financial aid is in jeopardy. Ethan assumes it's about college applications. They arrive at the counselor's office simultaneously, surprised to see each other. Dr. Morrison ushers them both in, closes the door, and drops the bomb: they're both applying early decision to Princeton, both applying to Yale and Columbia as backups, and both have nearly identical applications—stellar grades, leadership positions, perfect test scores. The problem? They both lack demonstrated collaborative skills. Hannah protests that she works with teams constantly. Dr. Morrison counters that she leads teams, never partners equally. Ethan argues his chess club works collaboratively. Dr. Morrison pulls out their recommendation questionnaires—neither listed any genuine partnership experiences. The chapter ends with Dr. Morrison explaining she has a solution, but both students need to hear her out before rejecting it. Hannah and Ethan exchange worried glances.

## Chapter 4: The Mandate

Dr. Morrison explains her terms: six weeks of mandatory joint study sessions, three times per week, minimum two hours each session. They'll collaborate on a research project, help each other with college application essays, and learn to work as partners instead of rivals. Hannah immediately objects—Ethan will sabotage her. Ethan argues this is unfair to both of them. Dr. Morrison remains firm: the skills they're lacking will matter more in college than another decimal point on their GPAs. She's requiring this because she believes they could help each other become better candidates. The leverage? She writes their recommendation letters, and no recommendation means no Princeton. Hannah calculates frantically—six weeks, three sessions per week, that's eighteen sessions total. If she schedules carefully, she can manage this without sacrificing other commitments. Ethan looks trapped. Dr. Morrison assigns them Study Room 3B in Wellington Library and tells them their first session is Friday at seven PM. The chapter ends with Hannah and Ethan leaving the office separately, both furious, neither speaking. Sarah finds Hannah in their room later, ranting about the injustice. Ethan tells Ryan he's stuck studying with "the enemy."

## Chapter 5: Study Room 3B

Friday evening arrives. Hannah shows up to Wellington Library Study Room 3B at 6:55 PM with her laptop, three library books, and a prepared agenda. Ethan arrives at 7:03 PM with just a notebook and one pen, which Hannah notes as typical carelessness. The study room is small—one large wooden table, uncomfortable chairs, fluorescent lighting, a window overlooking the dark quad. Hannah presents her agenda: research project topic selection, division of labor, and schedule for remaining sessions. Ethan counters that they should start with what Dr. Morrison actually assigned: genuine collaboration, not Hannah organizing and him executing. They argue about what collaboration even means. Hannah wants structure and clear responsibilities. Ethan wants flexibility and equal input. An hour passes and they've accomplished nothing except establishing that they can't agree on anything. Hannah accuses Ethan of not taking this seriously. Ethan accuses Hannah of being a control freak. The chapter ends with them agreeing to each bring three research topic proposals to the next session, neither willing to admit this is going to be impossible.

## Chapter 6: Compromise Tastes Bitter

Monday's session starts with research topic proposals. Hannah brings three options: all focused on literature analysis, all safe topics she knows she can dominate. Ethan brings three options that are broader and more ambitious but vaguer. They reject all six. Professor Brennan mentioned in class that the school library has original correspondence from a 1920s Cambridge Prep alumnus who became a diplomat. Neither Hannah nor Ethan has explored it because it doesn't fit their usual academic interests. After forty minutes of stalemate, Ethan suggests this as neutral ground—neither has the advantage. Hannah hates admitting it's a good idea. They agree to split research: Hannah takes the biographical background and historical context, Ethan takes the diplomatic correspondence analysis. They'll meet Wednesday to compare notes. As they're leaving, they almost collide in the doorway. For a moment, they're close enough that Hannah notices Ethan has dark circles under his eyes like he hasn't slept. Ethan notices Hannah's hands are shaking slightly, the way his do when anxiety spikes. Neither mentions it. The chapter ends with both returning to their dorms feeling unsettled by the brief moment of seeing each other as human rather than rival.

## Chapter 7: Late Nights and Library Dust

Wednesday's session finds them in the library archives with boxes of old correspondence. The archivist, elderly Mr. Patterson, is delighted someone finally wants to look at the collection. Hannah photographs documents methodically while Ethan reads them, occasionally pointing out interesting passages. They work in silence for ninety minutes, surprisingly efficient. When Ethan finds a letter describing the diplomat's anxiety about an important negotiation, he reads it aloud without thinking. The language is formal but the emotion is raw—fear of failure, pressure to represent his country, doubt about his abilities. Hannah looks up from her photographs, struck by something in Ethan's voice. He's reading it like he understands those feelings personally. The moment passes quickly. They pack up at nine PM when the library closes. Walking back across the quad, Hannah asks if Ethan thinks pressure was different in the 1920s. Ethan says pressure is probably constant across generations, just aimed at different targets. It's the closest they've come to a real conversation. The chapter ends with them going separate directions to their dorms, both thinking about what the other said.

## Chapter 8: The Cracks Show

Friday's session is interrupted by a fire drill. Hannah and Ethan stand on the library lawn with other students, waiting for the all-clear. Jennifer Campbell makes a snide comment about Hannah and Ethan's "study dates," suggesting Hannah is using the sessions to sabotage Ethan. Ethan surprises Hannah by shutting Jennifer down coldly, saying if anyone's threatened by collaboration it's Jennifer, who's been ranked third for three years. Jennifer storms off. Hannah doesn't thank Ethan but gives him a brief nod. When they return to Study Room 3B, the atmosphere is slightly less hostile. They divide writing responsibilities for their research paper: Hannah will draft the historical context section, Ethan will draft the analysis section, they'll trade and edit each other's work. As they're finishing, Hannah's phone buzzes—her mother calling about whether she needs money for application fees. Hannah steps into the hallway, and Ethan overhears her insisting she's fine, her scholarship covers it, she doesn't need help. When Hannah returns, her expression is carefully blank. Ethan doesn't comment but realizes Hannah's perfectionism might be about more than just grades. The chapter ends with them agreeing to meet Monday with their drafted sections.

## Chapter 9: Red Pen Wars

Monday's session involves editing each other's work. Hannah reads Ethan's analysis section and is forced to admit it's brilliant—insightful, well-argued, sophisticated. Her section on historical context is thorough and meticulous but less compelling. Ethan's edits on her work are honest: he marks places where she's being safe instead of analytical, where she's reciting facts instead of interpreting. Hannah's first instinct is defensive anger, but she rereads and realizes he's right. Her edits on his work tighten his arguments and add necessary context. They spend two hours trading the document back and forth, actually improving each other's writing. By the end, neither can tell who wrote which parts—it's genuinely collaborative. Professor Brennan would be impressed. As they save the final version, Hannah admits out loud that Ethan's analysis was good. Ethan says her research was thorough. It's not quite compliments but it's not hostility either. Sarah notices Hannah seems less stressed lately and asks if the study sessions are getting better. Hannah doesn't want to admit it but says they're "tolerable." The chapter ends with Hannah reviewing their combined paper and feeling surprised by how good it actually is.

## Chapter 10: The First Real Conversation

Friday's session starts with Dr. Morrison checking their progress. She reads their research paper and is clearly pleased—this is the collaboration she wanted to see. She tells them to start working on their college application essays next week, helping each other improve them. After Dr. Morrison leaves, there's an awkward pause. They're ahead of schedule on the research project, so tonight's session doesn't have a clear agenda. Ethan asks about Hannah's Princeton essay topic. Hannah hesitates, then shares that she's writing about being a scholarship student and what that pressure taught her. Ethan admits he's struggling with his essay because everything he writes sounds like it's supposed to impress admissions officers rather than being honest. Hannah asks what he'd write if he was being honest. Ethan pauses, then says he'd write about anxiety and pressure and feeling like he's failing even when he succeeds. It's the most vulnerable either has been with the other. Hannah doesn't mock him; she says that would be a better essay than most people write. The chapter ends with them talking for twenty minutes after their scheduled session ends, not about academics but about what they're actually afraid of. When they leave the library at nine-thirty, something between them has shifted from rivalry to the beginning of understanding.

## Chapter 11: Essay Surgery

Monday's session focuses on college essays. Hannah brings her Princeton essay about being a scholarship student. Ethan reads it carefully and says it's good but feels like she's performing the "hardworking scholarship kid" role rather than being herself. Hannah bristles but asks what he means. Ethan points out where her voice disappears into what she thinks admissions wants to hear. He asks what she's actually afraid of—not the acceptable answer, the real one. Hannah admits she's afraid of proving everyone right who thinks she doesn't belong at Cambridge Prep. Ethan helps her rewrite the opening to be more honest about that fear. When Hannah reads Ethan's draft about anxiety and pressure, she recognizes the same problem: he's apologizing for struggling instead of owning his experience. She encourages him to be direct about taking medication for anxiety, about the panic attacks, about the facade of effortless success. By the end of the session, both essays are drastically improved and much more vulnerable. The chapter ends with them realizing they're better writers with each other's help than alone.

## Chapter 12: The Scholarship Student

Wednesday's session starts with Hannah mentioning she needs to leave by nine PM for her campus job in the dining hall—she buses tables three nights a week. Ethan didn't know Hannah worked. Hannah explains matter-of-factly that her scholarship covers tuition and room, but she needs income for books, supplies, application fees. She's worked since freshman year. Ethan asks if that's why she's so scheduled—she literally has less time than other students. Hannah says she can't afford to waste time or fail; she's here on merit, not family name. It's the first time she's directly acknowledged the class difference between them. Ethan is quiet, then admits his family name means he's never had to worry about affording anything, but it also means failure would be public family disappointment. They're both trapped by different kinds of pressure. Hannah shares that she feels like an imposter among wealthy students who seem naturally confident. Ethan reveals his "effortless" success is performance art covering constant anxiety. The chapter ends with Hannah leaving for her dining hall job and Ethan watching her go, understanding her perfectionism differently now.

## Chapter 13: The Wallace Name

Friday's session gets interrupted when Ethan receives a call from his father on the dorm hallway pay phone. Hannah waits in Study Room 3B, overhearing through the open door. His father is asking about early decision applications, whether Ethan is confident about Princeton, reminding him that three generations of Wallace men attended Princeton and Ethan shouldn't be the one to break tradition. Ethan's voice is tight, agreeable, saying all the right things. When he returns to the study room, he looks pale. Hannah asks if he's okay. Ethan sits down heavily and admits his father doesn't know about the anxiety, the medication, the panic attacks. The Wallace men are surgeons, lawyers, senators—they don't have anxiety disorders. If Ethan doesn't get into Princeton, he's not just disappointing himself; he's failing the family legacy. Hannah quietly says that sounds suffocating. Ethan laughs bitterly and says at least her success is actually hers. The chapter ends with Ethan admitting he envies that Hannah's achievements aren't shadowed by family expectations, while Hannah realizes privilege comes with its own cage.

## Chapter 14: Study Break

Sarah convinces Hannah to take Saturday evening off for the fall formal dance in Ashford Hall. Hannah initially refuses—she has SAT prep and college essay revisions—but Sarah insists she needs one night of being seventeen. At the dance, Hannah wears a borrowed dress and feels out of place among students in designer gowns. She spots Ethan across the room with Jennifer Campbell, who's clearly flirting with him. Ryan and Sarah gravitate together, leaving Hannah alone by the refreshment table. Ethan extricates himself from Jennifer and approaches Hannah. They make awkward small talk about the decorations, the music, anything except academics. When a slow song starts, Ethan asks Hannah to dance. She's surprised but accepts. Dancing is strange—they've spent hours together in the study room but this is different, more personal. Ethan mentions they've been studying together for four weeks now; only two more weeks of mandatory sessions left. Hannah realizes she's not sure she wants them to end. The chapter ends with them swaying to music, both aware that their relationship is changing into something neither expected or can quite name yet.

## Chapter 15: The Safe Space

Monday's session feels different after the dance. They're more comfortable with each other, less guarded. They finish editing Hannah's Columbia supplemental essay, then Ethan asks about Hannah's family. She shares that her parents are proud of her Cambridge Prep acceptance but don't fully understand the pressure—they think good grades should be enough, don't grasp the competition. Ethan asks if she ever tells them how hard it actually is. Hannah admits she doesn't want them to worry or think the sacrifice isn't worth it. Ethan understands—he doesn't tell his father about anxiety for similar reasons. They realize Study Room 3B has become the one place where they don't perform. Hannah doesn't have to be the perfect scholarship student; Ethan doesn't have to be the effortless Wallace legacy. They can admit exhaustion, fear, imperfection. Sarah later asks Hannah if she's developing feelings for Ethan. Hannah deflects but doesn't deny it. The chapter ends with Hannah realizing these study sessions have become the best part of her week, and that's terrifying because Ethan is still technically her rival.

## Chapter 16: Midterm Crisis

Midterms arrive and both Hannah and Ethan are drowning in exams, papers, and college application deadlines. Wednesday's study session becomes a joint cramming marathon—they quiz each other for AP Lit, review calculus problems together, and stress-eat vending machine snacks. At midnight, when the library closes, they're both exhausted. Walking back across the quad, Ethan admits he had a panic attack yesterday before his calculus exam. Hannah asks what helps when that happens. Ethan says medication helps prevent them, but in the moment, he has to remind himself that grades aren't life or death even when they feel that way. Hannah confesses she sometimes thinks if she fails at Cambridge Prep, she fails her family's sacrifice and proves she never deserved to be here. Ethan says that's not how failure works—she's earned everything she has. It's the kindest thing anyone's said to Hannah in three years. The chapter ends with them standing outside the library, neither wanting to end the conversation, both aware they've crossed from rivals to something more complicated—maybe friends, maybe more than friends.

## Chapter 17: Application Season Pressure

Dr. Morrison holds senior class meetings about early decision deadlines. November first is two weeks away. Hannah and Ethan both finalize their Princeton applications. Friday's study session involves reviewing each other's complete application packages one final time. Hannah reads Ethan's essays, his activity descriptions, his additional information section where he disclosed his anxiety disorder. It's honest and compelling—the real Ethan, not the facade. Ethan reviews Hannah's application and tells her it's exceptional, that Princeton would be lucky to have her. The competitiveness between them has evaporated. They're genuinely rooting for each other now, which feels strange given they're applying to the same school for the same limited spots. Professor Brennan approaches them in the library and mentions their collaborative research paper was the best student work he's seen in five years. He asks if they've considered co-authoring something for an academic journal. Both are surprised—they never thought about collaboration beyond Dr. Morrison's mandate. The chapter ends with them submitting their Princeton applications, knowing decisions will come in mid-December, and realizing the six-week mandate ends next week.

## Chapter 18: The Last Mandated Session

Monday marks their final mandatory study session. Dr. Morrison checks in and congratulates them on successful collaboration—their research paper, improved essays, and visible growth in working as partners. She says the mandate is complete; any future study sessions are their choice. After she leaves, Hannah and Ethan sit in Study Room 3B feeling strange. Eighteen sessions over six weeks have become routine. Ethan asks if Hannah wants to keep meeting. Hannah says yes without hesitation, then feels embarrassed by how quickly she agreed. They decide to keep their Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule but make it optional, no pressure. They work on scholarship applications for Hannah and Yale supplemental essays for Ethan. The atmosphere is relaxed, comfortable. At nine PM, they pack up but linger in the study room. Ethan mentions Thanksgiving break is next week—they won't see each other for five days. Hannah realizes she'll miss these sessions. The chapter ends with them walking back to the dorms together, conversation flowing easily, both aware that what started as forced collaboration has become genuine partnership and possibly something more.

## Chapter 19: Thanksgiving Realization

Thanksgiving break sends students home. Hannah returns to Worcester, helping her mother with holiday prep and picking up extra shifts at her parents' diner to save money. Her parents ask about Cambridge Prep, and Hannah finds herself talking about Ethan—about the study sessions, the collaboration, how he's not who she thought he was. Her mother notices Hannah smiling while talking about him. Meanwhile, Ethan spends Thanksgiving at his family's Connecticut estate, enduring his father's interrogation about Princeton prospects and college interviews. His younger sister asks if Ethan has a girlfriend. He says no, but thinks about Hannah—about how she understands the pressure, how she pushes him to be honest, how Study Room 3B feels like the only place he can breathe. Both return to Cambridge Prep the Sunday after Thanksgiving. They run into each other in the library Monday morning before classes. The greeting feels loaded—they missed each other during break, though neither says it directly. The chapter ends with them planning to meet for their usual Monday evening session, now voluntary, both looking forward to it more than they want to admit.

## Chapter 20: Early Decision Results

December fifteenth arrives—early decision notification day. Hannah and Ethan agreed to check results together in Study Room 3B at four PM when the portal updates. Hannah logs in first. Her screen loads: "Congratulations! You have been accepted to Princeton University Class of..." She's in. She should be ecstatic, but she can't celebrate until she knows Ethan's decision. He logs in. His screen loads: "After careful consideration, we have deferred your application to the regular decision pool." Deferred, not rejected, but not accepted either. The room goes silent. Hannah doesn't know what to say. Ethan closes his laptop and says he's fine, it's fine, he expected this. But his hands are shaking. Hannah wants to comfort him but doesn't know how. Ethan congratulates her genuinely—she earned Princeton, she deserves it. Then he leaves the study room, walking out before Hannah can respond. She sits alone with her acceptance letter, feeling wrong about celebrating when Ethan is hurting. The chapter ends with Hannah realizing she cares more about Ethan's pain than her own success, which is when she admits to herself that this is no longer just friendship.

## Chapter 21: Picking Up Pieces

Hannah finds Ethan the next day in the library, researching how to strengthen deferred applications. She sits down without asking and says they're going to fix this together. Ethan protests—she got in, she doesn't need to help him. Hannah says that's exactly why she can help; she has nothing left to prove and he needs someone who understands Princeton's expectations. For the next week, they work on Ethan's deferral strategy. Hannah helps him craft his letter of continued interest, identifies additional achievements to update, and gives honest feedback on strengthening his application. Ethan is vulnerable in ways Hannah hasn't seen—the facade is completely gone. He admits he's terrified of disappointing his father, of proving he's not actually as smart as everyone thought. Hannah tells him deferral isn't rejection; Princeton wants to see more, which means they see potential. She believes in him even if he doesn't believe in himself right now. The chapter ends with Ethan submitting his updated materials and thanking Hannah—not just for the help but for not abandoning him after she got what they were both competing for.

## Chapter 22: Christmas Break Clarity

Christmas break arrives. Hannah returns to Worcester with her Princeton acceptance but can't stop thinking about Ethan. She texts him from her parents' house—just checking in, asking how he's doing. They start texting regularly, conversations ranging from college stress to random observations to inside jokes from their study sessions. Ethan is with his family in Connecticut, facing his father's disappointment about the deferral. His father suggests Ethan isn't trying hard enough, doesn't want it enough. Ethan's sister finds him having a panic attack Christmas Eve and comforts him, asking who Hannah is—the girl Ethan keeps texting. Ethan admits Hannah is the only person who understands. Back at Cambridge Prep in January, Hannah and Ethan meet in Study Room 3B on the first day back. The greeting is warmer than before break—almost like they missed each other desperately. They sit close at the table, talking about break, families, pressure. Hannah admits she thought about him constantly. Ethan says the same. The chapter ends with them acknowledging silently that this is no longer about studying together—this is about not wanting to be apart.


## Chapter 23: The Announcement

Mid-January brings the valedictorian announcement. The entire senior class gathers in Ashford Hall for the academic honors assembly. Hannah sits with Sarah while Ethan sits with Ryan, both trying to appear calm. Dr. Morrison takes the podium and explains that this year's valedictorian race was the closest in Cambridge Prep history. The difference between first and second place is hundredths of a grade point—both candidates maintained exceptional performance across four years. She announces Hannah Price as valedictorian, Ethan Wallace as salutatorian. The room applauds. Hannah should feel triumphant after three years of competition, but instead she immediately looks for Ethan. He's clapping, smiling at her genuinely, no resentment visible. After the assembly, students congratulate Hannah while others commiserate with Ethan. Jennifer makes a snide comment about how close it was, implying luck over merit. Hannah approaches Ethan outside the hall. Before she can apologize or explain, he hugs her and says congratulations—she earned it. The chapter ends with Hannah confused by his reaction and her own lack of satisfaction in winning.

## Chapter 24: What Winning Costs

That evening, Hannah sits in her dorm room with her valedictorian certificate, feeling hollow. Sarah asks why she's not celebrating. Hannah admits she thought winning would feel different—validating, conclusive. Instead she feels guilty about Ethan and uncertain whether the three-year competition was worth the cost. She gave up friendships, social life, relaxation, all for hundredths of a grade point that ultimately mean less than she thought. Sarah gently points out that Hannah seems happier in the past two months working with Ethan than she's been in three years competing against him. Meanwhile, Ethan tells Ryan he's genuinely relieved he's not valedictorian. Ryan is confused—wasn't that the whole point? Ethan explains that losing to Hannah doesn't hurt because she earned it fairly, but more importantly, the rivalry that consumed him for three years suddenly seems insignificant. He found something better than winning: someone who understands him and makes him better without demanding perfection. The chapter ends with both Hannah and Ethan realizing the competition mattered less than the partnership they built.

## Chapter 25: Study Room Confessions

Hannah and Ethan meet in Study Room 3B on their regular Monday session, though neither has a clear study agenda anymore. Hannah tells Ethan she's sorry she won, which makes him laugh—she shouldn't apologize for earning something. Ethan admits he's been thinking about what matters: the perfect GPA, the valedictorian title, even Princeton acceptance matter less than finding someone who sees past the performance. Hannah says she understands—she spent three years proving she deserved to be at Cambridge Prep, but Ethan was the first person who made her feel like she actually belonged. They sit in the study room that was their battleground, now their sanctuary, and acknowledge what's been growing between them. Ethan asks what happens now—she's going to Princeton, he might still get in or might go to Yale. Hannah says she doesn't want distance or different schools to end what they've built. Ethan agrees. They don't label it yet, but the conversation shifts from academic partnership to something clearly romantic. The chapter ends with them holding hands across the table, both aware they've moved beyond rivals or even friends into territory that feels inevitable and right.

## Chapter 26: Senior Awards Night

February brings Senior Awards Night, where Hannah will give her valedictorian speech. She's written and rewritten it a dozen times, struggling with what to say. The traditional speech celebrates achievement and thanks teachers, but Hannah wants to say something true. She shows Ethan her draft in Study Room 3B. He reads it and says it's good but safe—the same problem they had with college essays. He asks what she actually learned at Cambridge Prep. Hannah thinks, then admits the most important thing was learning that competition without respect is empty, and that the person pushing you hardest can become the person who understands you best. Ethan says she should say that. The night of the ceremony, Ashford Hall fills with parents, faculty, and students. Hannah's parents sit in the front row, proud and a little overwhelmed. Ethan's father is there, still disappointed about Princeton but present. When Hannah takes the podium as valedictorian, she looks out at her class and then at Ethan. The chapter ends with her beginning her speech, nervous but committed to honesty.

## Chapter 27: The Speech

Hannah's valedictorian speech starts traditionally—thanking faculty, acknowledging parents' sacrifices, celebrating the senior class. Then she shifts tone. She talks about Cambridge Prep's competitive culture, about how easy it is to become so focused on being first that you forget why you're competing. She admits she spent three years obsessed with being valedictorian, sacrificing friendships and experiences, measuring her worth in decimal points. Then she looks directly at Ethan. Hannah publicly thanks Ethan Wallace for three years of rivalry that pushed her to be better, and for the past few months of partnership that taught her something more important than winning. She says that real excellence isn't about beating others—it's about finding people who challenge you and support you simultaneously. Competition without respect is empty; achievement without connection is hollow. The person who was her greatest rival became the person who understood her best. The speech ends with Hannah saying she's proud to be valedictorian, but she's more grateful for what she learned beyond grades. The room is silent, then erupts in applause. The chapter ends with Ethan watching Hannah, both knowing what comes next.

## Chapter 28: After the Ceremony

After the awards ceremony, families mingle in Ashford Hall with refreshments. Hannah's parents congratulate her, though her mother whispers that the speech was unusually personal—is Ethan the boy Hannah mentioned at Thanksgiving? Hannah admits yes. Ethan's father corners him, asking if he's embarrassed to be publicly acknowledged as second place. Ethan surprises himself by saying no—Hannah was right in her speech, and losing to her taught him more than winning would have. His father doesn't understand, but Ethan doesn't care anymore. Outside the hall, Hannah finds Ethan on the quad. February air is cold, campus lights illuminating patches of snow. She asks if she embarrassed him by mentioning him so directly in her speech. Ethan says it was the best part—someone finally acknowledged that competition can be complicated and connection matters more than rank. They stand close, breath visible in winter air. Hannah admits she's been scared to say this, but the past four months changed everything for her. The chapter ends with Ethan saying the same—he's been scared too, but not anymore.

## Chapter 29: Study Room 3B, Revisited

Ethan suggests they go somewhere warmer. They walk to Wellington Library, still open for evening studying. Study Room 3B is empty, their usual space. They sit at the table where they spent eighteen mandatory sessions and countless voluntary ones. Hannah says this room used to represent everything she hated—forced collaboration with her rival, wasted time she could spend studying alone. Now it's her favorite place on campus. Ethan agrees—Study Room 3B is where he learned to stop performing, where he could admit anxiety and imperfection without judgment. They talk about what happens next. Regular decision results come in April. Hannah is committed to Princeton. Ethan might get in off the deferral, might end up at Yale or Columbia. Either way, they're not letting college separate what they've built. The distance between New Haven and Princeton is manageable. Hannah asks what they actually are now—rivals, friends, something else? Ethan stands, walks around the table to where Hannah sits. He says they're whatever they want to be, and what he wants is to stop pretending he hasn't been falling for her since November. The chapter ends with their first kiss, soft and certain, in the study room that transformed them from enemies to partners to something more.

## Chapter 30: The Perfect Score

Spring semester progresses. Ethan gets his regular decision results in April—accepted to Princeton off the deferral wait list. He'll join Hannah there in the fall. They celebrate in Study Room 3B, now their established space. Senior year's final months are busy with graduation prep, but Hannah and Ethan navigate it together. Hannah maintains her perfect GPA through the end; Ethan finishes strong as salutatorian. They attend senior prom together, officially a couple now, which causes minor scandal among students who remember them as bitter rivals. Jennifer Campbell makes one last snide comment; they ignore her. At graduation in June, Hannah gives a shorter speech than her valedictorian address but reiterates the theme: that achievement shared is sweeter than victory alone. Her parents and Ethan's parents meet, an awkward introduction of working-class Worcester to Connecticut old money, but both families see their children are genuinely happy. After graduation, Hannah and Ethan walk through Cambridge Prep campus one final time, past Ashford Hall and Wellington Library and the dorms where they competed and eventually connected. Ethan asks what Hannah thinks the perfect score actually is. Hannah says it's not a grade or a rank—it's finding someone who pushes you to be better while accepting you exactly as you are. They end up at Study Room 3B, empty now that semester is over. They sit at their table one last time, holding hands, both heading to Princeton in the fall, both grateful that forced collaboration became genuine partnership became love. The novel ends with them leaving the study room together, closing the door on rivalry and opening the door to everything that comes next.
