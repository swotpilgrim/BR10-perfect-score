# Chapter 30: The Perfect Score

**Four Years Later**

The Princeton library was nothing like Study Room 3B at Cambridge Prep. It was larger, grander, filled with gothic architecture and students who moved with the confidence of people who knew they belonged.

But the corner table on the third floor of Firestone Library had become ours anyway.

I sat with my laptop open, working on my senior thesis about educational equity and access. Across from me, Ethan was reviewing medical school applications—his GPA from Princeton solid, his MCAT scores strong, his personal statement honest about anxiety and why he wanted to be the kind of doctor who understood that healing meant more than just treating symptoms.

Some things hadn't changed. We still studied together. We still challenged each other. I still color-coded my notes, and Ethan still showed up with organized chaos that somehow worked.

But some things had changed completely.

I no longer measured my worth in decimal points. Ethan no longer performed effortless brilliance. We'd both learned—slowly, imperfectly, together—that being human mattered more than being perfect.

"How's your thesis going?" Ethan asked, looking up from his laptop.

"Good. I'm arguing that mandatory collaboration programs in competitive academic environments can reduce achievement gaps and improve emotional outcomes."

He grinned. "Using our Cambridge Prep experience as a case study?"

"Maybe. Dr. Morrison gave me permission to interview her about the program."

"What did she say?"

"That forcing us together was the best counseling decision she'd made in twenty years. That watching us transform from rivals to partners justified every angry parent email she received about the mandate."

"There were angry parent emails?"

"Apparently my mother called to complain that the sessions were taking time away from my studying. And your father called to say collaboration was making you soft."

Ethan laughed. "That sounds right."

My phone buzzed. A text from Sarah, who was finishing her senior year at Brown:

**Sarah:** How's the thesis? How's the boyfriend? When are you visiting?

I smiled and texted back:

**Hannah:** Thesis is good. Boyfriend is applying to med schools. Visiting next month?

**Sarah:** Perfect. Bring Ethan. We miss you both.

"Sarah says hi," I told Ethan.

"Tell her hi back. And that I still maintain Heathcliff is irredeemable."

"She doesn't care about your Heathcliff opinions."

"Everyone should care about my Heathcliff opinions. They're correct."

I threw a pen cap at him. He caught it, grinning.

Princeton had been good to us. Different from Cambridge Prep—less pressure, more freedom, bigger and more anonymous. But we'd found our place. I'd joined organizations focused on educational access. Ethan had volunteered at the student health center, working with peers struggling with anxiety. We'd both maintained strong grades, but neither of us obsessed over class rank anymore.

The thing that mattered was this: we'd made it. Four years long-distance during my first year when Ethan was still finishing at Cambridge Prep (he'd actually needed that gap year for medical experience anyway). Then three years together at Princeton, navigating college while maintaining the partnership we'd built.

"What are you thinking about?" Ethan asked, watching me.

"How far we've come from Study Room 3B."

"Long way."

"But also not that far. We're still us. Still studying together, still arguing about literature, still making each other better."

"Still in love," Ethan added quietly.

"Still in love," I agreed.

He reached across the table and took my hand—a gesture we'd done thousands of times since that first Study Room 3B confession. Familiar and comfortable and exactly right.

"I have something for you," he said.

"It's not my birthday."

"I know. But I've been carrying this around for two weeks waiting for the right moment, and I think this is it."

He pulled a small box from his bag. Not a ring box—I wasn't graduating for another two months, and we'd talked about waiting until after grad school for that kind of commitment. But a box nonetheless.

I opened it. Inside was a key—old, brass, slightly tarnished.

"Is this—"

"The key to Study Room 3B. Mr. Patterson gave it to me at graduation. Said the room was ours in spirit anyway, might as well make it official."

I stared at the key, throat tight with emotion. "You've been carrying this around for four years?"

"Three and a half years. I gave it to my mom for safekeeping when I moved into the dorms freshman year. Got it back last week when I was home for spring break." He smiled. "I wanted you to have it. To remember where we started."

"I could never forget where we started."

"I know. But still. That room changed everything. Seemed right that you should have the key."

I closed my fingers around the key, feeling the weight of it. Study Room 3B. Where rivals became partners. Where competition transformed into collaboration. Where we'd learned the perfect score.

"Thank you," I whispered.

"You're welcome."

We sat in the Princeton library, holding hands across the table, four years after Cambridge Prep graduation. In two months, I'd graduate from Princeton. In August, Ethan would start medical school—likely here, though we were waiting on final acceptances. I'd begin a master's program in education policy, putting my thesis research into practice.

Different paths forward, but still together. Still partners. Still us.

My phone buzzed again. This time, an email from the journal that had accepted our Cambridge Prep research paper four years ago—the collaborative work on diplomatic correspondence that Professor Brennan had encouraged.

**Subject: Publication Anniversary**

*Dear Authors,*

*We wanted to let you know that your paper, "Collaborative Analysis of Early 20th Century Diplomatic Correspondence," recently became our most-cited student publication. Your synthesis of historical research and analytical frameworks continues to influence young scholars. Congratulations on work that has stood the test of time.*

I showed Ethan. He read it and grinned.

"We're academic celebrities."

"The research paper that started as a forced collaboration requirement is now influencing scholars."

"Dr. Morrison's plan goes deeper than we thought."

"She's probably somewhere being extremely smug about this."

"She's earned it."

I saved the email, adding it to a folder of Cambridge Prep memories. The folder included our original research paper, photos from graduation, the valedictorian speech I'd given, screenshots of text conversations from those early months when we were falling for each other but too scared to admit it.

And now, the key to Study Room 3B.

Artifacts of transformation. Evidence that sometimes the requirements you resist teach you the most important lessons.

"What do you think defines the perfect score now?" Ethan asked. "Four years later, with perspective?"

I thought about it. "It's not an endpoint. Not valedictorian or Princeton acceptance or any single achievement."

"No?"

"No. The perfect score is the journey. The growth. The person who challenges you to be better while accepting you exactly as you are. The partnership that survives distance and stress and all the things that should tear people apart but somehow make you stronger."

"So us."

"Yeah. Us." I smiled. "What about you? What's your definition?"

"Love that doesn't require perfection. Support that doesn't demand performance. Someone who sees you at your worst and stays anyway." He squeezed my hand. "Also us."

"We're very self-congratulatory."

"We've earned it. We went from rivals who couldn't stand each other to partners who can't imagine being apart. That's worth celebrating."

He wasn't wrong.

We studied for another hour, comfortable in the silence, occasionally asking questions or reading passages aloud. The same rhythms we'd established in Study Room 3B, carried forward to Princeton, and likely forward to wherever we went next.

When the library announced closing, we packed up our materials with practiced efficiency. Ethan's papers, my color-coded notes, both our laptops carefully stowed.

Outside, Princeton's campus glowed under exterior lights. Spring evening, warm enough to walk slowly. We headed toward our residential colleges—still different buildings, but close enough to meet for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late-night study sessions.

At the fork in the path, Ethan pulled me close.

"I love you, Hannah Price. Valedictorian, educational equity advocate, person who still argues with me about Heathcliff despite being objectively wrong."

"I love you too, Ethan Wallace. Almost-valedictorian, future doctor, person who still thinks medication and honesty about anxiety are shameful despite being objectively wrong about that too."

He kissed me—soft and familiar and perfect in its imperfection.

"Same time tomorrow?" he asked.

"Our table. Three PM."

"I'll bring coffee."

"I'll bring the impossible standards we're no longer trying to meet."

He laughed. "Perfect."

I watched him walk toward his dorm, still carrying the key to Study Room 3B in my pocket. Behind me, Princeton's library rose against the darkening sky. Ahead, Ethan's future path and my future path, diverging slightly but never completely separating.

Tomorrow, we'd study together. Next month, we'd graduate. This summer, we'd figure out the logistics of medical school and master's programs. Next year, new challenges. The year after, more growth.

But through it all—partnership. Collaboration. Love that didn't require perfection.

The perfect score.

Not the grade I'd earned or the rank I'd achieved or even the Princeton degree I was about to receive.

The perfect score was standing in the April evening thinking about a boy who'd started as my rival and become my partner. Who challenged me and supported me and made me better while accepting me exactly as I was.

The perfect score was learning that winning meant nothing if you were celebrating alone.

The perfect score was Study Room 3B and forced collaboration and Dr. Morrison's evil genius plan.

The perfect score was this: loving someone who understood the cost of achievement and valued you beyond it.

The perfect score was Ethan.

And me.

Together.

Always.

I smiled and headed toward my dorm, already looking forward to tomorrow's study session.

The perfect score, I thought.

Finally understanding what that actually meant.
