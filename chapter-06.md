# Chapter 6: Compromise Tastes Bitter

Monday evening, 7:00 PM exactly. I arrive at Study Room 3B at 6:58, carrying three meticulously prepared research proposals, each with annotated bibliography and preliminary outline.

I spent all weekend on them. Focused, specific, academically rigorous. Ethan can't dismiss them.

He walks in at 7:02—two minutes late, his standard—with the same single notebook and pen. No visible research materials. I force myself not to comment.

"Ready to share proposals?" I ask, tone neutral.

"Sure." Ethan drops into the chair across from me. "You go first."

I pull out my first proposal. "Literary analysis of class conflict in early 20th century American boarding school fiction. I'd examine texts from 1910-1940, analyzing how authors depicted scholarship students versus legacy students—"

"Too narrow," Ethan interrupts. "You're looking at fiction, not actual educational policy. It's an English paper, not research."

My jaw tightens. "Fiction reflects societal attitudes—"

"But it doesn't give us real data about educational equity. You're hiding behind literature because it's your comfort zone."

The accuracy stings. "Fine. Second proposal: comparative analysis of scholarship retention rates at New England boarding schools from 1990-2020—"

"Where would you get that data? Most schools don't publish that. You'd spend four weeks just trying to access information."

"I could submit data requests—"

"Which take months. We have six weeks total." Ethan leans back. "Good ideas for a semester-long project. Not for our timeline."

I slam my folder closed. "Then what's your brilliant idea? Since mine are all worthless."

"I didn't say worthless. I said impractical." Ethan flips to a page. "My first proposal: history of performance pressure in elite academic environments, from Victorian-era boarding schools through modern prep schools."

"That's incredibly vague. 'Performance pressure' is too broad. That's not research, that's philosophical musing."

"It's a framework. We'd narrow through specific case studies—"

"Which you haven't identified. You're presenting concepts, not research designs."

"I'm opening with ideas for discussion, not dictating final projects like you did last session."

"I'm being specific because specificity makes projects achievable."

"And I'm being open because openness allows collaboration."

We're glaring again. Forty-eight hours later and we're back to the same argument—structure versus flexibility, control versus cooperation.

"Your second proposal?" I ask through gritted teeth.

"Mental health resources at boarding schools. How accessibility differs by student socioeconomic background."

"Do you have contacts willing to share confidential health data?"

"Do you have access to retention statistics?"

"So your proposal has the same problems you criticized mine for."

"At least I'm addressing a real problem instead of hiding behind literary analysis."

"Literary analysis isn't hiding. It's valid methodology."

"For an English thesis. Not for a project addressing actual educational inequity."

My hands shake as I grip my folder. I want to walk out. I want to prove this collaboration is impossible.

But I also want the recommendation letter. Princeton. Valedictorian.

So I stay. "Your third proposal?"

"Performance metrics and mental health outcomes. Correlation between academic pressure and student wellbeing."

"Still vague. Still lacking methodology."

"Still more innovative than hundred-year-old novels."

Silence. Tense and hostile.

Forty minutes in and we've rejected all six proposals. We're not collaborating—we're just explaining why the other's ideas won't work.

This is exactly what Dr. Morrison predicted.

"This isn't working," I say.

"No kidding."

I stare at the wall, at half-erased equations from some other study group. Actual collaboration requires finding common ground, not defending territories.

"Neither of us is willing to concede," Ethan says.

"Because conceding feels like losing."

"Which is the problem. This isn't supposed to be about winning and losing."

"But it is," I say honestly. "You're my competition."

Ethan is quiet. When he speaks, his voice is thoughtful. "What if we chose something neither of us has an advantage in?"

"What do you mean?"

"Your proposals are all literature-based. Mine are sociology-psychology. What if we chose a topic that's new to both of us? Where neither can dominate because neither is the expert?"

It's not terrible. "Like what?"

Ethan frowns. "Wasn't there something Professor Brennan mentioned? About the library having some historical collection?"

I search my memory. Last Wednesday's AP Lit covered epistolary narratives. Brennan went on a tangent about letter-writing. He mentioned—

"The diplomat correspondence," I say. "Cambridge Prep alumnus from the 1920s who became a State Department official. Donated his papers to the library archives."

"Right. We could research that. Historical figure, boarding school connection, diplomatic career. It ties to educational outcomes and social mobility through a specific historical case study."

"Neither of us knows diplomatic history."

"Exactly. Equal footing."

I consider it. Unfamiliar territory makes me nervous—I like being competent, prepared, knowing more than anyone else. But Ethan's right that our inability to compromise comes from both of us maintaining advantage.

"It's very specific," I say slowly.

"Specific enough for six weeks. Broad enough for different angles—you could take biographical and historical context, I could analyze the diplomatic writing. We'd both contribute equally without overlapping."

Balanced. Practical. Actually collaborative.

I hate that Ethan thought of it first.

But this might be our only path forward.

"We'd need to see if the archives are accessible," I say.

"Library's open until ten. We could check now."

7:43. We still have over an hour of mandated time.

"Okay," I agree.

Ethan looks almost surprised. We pack up in awkward silence and leave Study Room 3B.

The library archives are in the basement, down a narrow staircase I've walked past but never descended. A hand-lettered sign reads: Wellington Archives - Ring Bell for Assistance.

Ethan rings the bell. An elderly man emerges from the stacks, glasses perched on his nose, wearing a worn cardigan.

"Students! Wonderful. No one ever visits." He beams. "I'm Mr. Patterson, the archivist. What can I help you find?"

"We're researching the diplomatic correspondence collection," Ethan says. "From the Cambridge Prep alumnus?"

"Ah! The Morrison Collection—no relation to your college counselor. Ambassador Edward Morrison, class of 1919. Fascinating papers." Mr. Patterson's enthusiasm is infectious. "History project?"

"Research project," I say. "His correspondence from the 1920s specifically."

"Excellent period. Junior attaché at Paris embassy, then London. The letters show wonderful detail of diplomatic life. Follow me."

Mr. Patterson leads us into the climate-controlled archives room. Rows of labeled boxes. He pulls out three labeled Morrison, E. - Correspondence 1920-1929.

"Personal letters. Handle carefully—no food or drink, pencils only. You can photograph documents with your phones." He sets the boxes on a reading table. "I'll be at the desk if you need anything."

He leaves us with 1920s history.

Ethan and I stand on opposite sides, looking at the boxes.

"Want to see if there's anything useful?" he asks.

We put on the cotton gloves provided and open the first box. Letters arranged chronologically in protective sleeves. Elegant cursive on aged paper, some with US Embassy letterheads.

I pull out a letter dated June 1923, from Paris. Ethan opens one from August 1925, London. We read in silence.

After ten minutes, I look up. "These are detailed. Embassy functions, diplomatic negotiations, social hierarchies."

"And he references Cambridge Prep constantly," Ethan adds. "Listen: 'My years at Cambridge prepared me for navigating these social waters more than my Yale degree ever did. I learned early how to move between scholarship student circles and legacy family expectations.'"

Our eyes meet.

"He was a scholarship student," I say.

"At a boarding school in 1919. Before financial aid was formalized." Ethan scans the letter. "This is about class navigation and educational access through a personal historical lens."

"And diplomatic achievement despite socioeconomic barriers."

We're getting excited, ideas building instead of competing.

"I'll take his biographical background," I say. "Family, how he got to Cambridge Prep, education path. Historical context of scholarship students then."

"I'll analyze his correspondence for themes about class, education, professional success. How boarding school shaped his diplomatic career."

"We'd need to coordinate so our sections connect."

"That's the collaboration part."

First time we've agreed without arguing.

We spend forty minutes photographing letters, taking notes, getting interested in Edward Morrison's story. When Mr. Patterson announces the library is closing in ten minutes, we have the foundation of an actual research project.

The walk up the narrow archives stairs is cramped. At the top, Ethan pauses to hold the door. I step through as he moves forward. We nearly collide.

"Sorry—" we both say, stepping back.

Close enough to notice details I usually miss. Dark circles under Ethan's eyes, like he hasn't slept in days. The faint tremor in his hands that he hides by pocketing them.

He's looking at me with similar attention. I wonder what he sees. My own sleepless nights? The anxiety I hide behind organization?

For three seconds, we're not rivals. We're two exhausted students surviving the same impossible pressure.

Then the moment passes. We step apart.

"Monday went better than Friday," Ethan says.

"Low bar."

"True. But still progress."

We leave the library. At the path split—him toward Thoreau, me toward Whitman—we pause.

"Wednesday session?" I ask.

"Seven PM. Same miserable study room."

"See you then."

"Yeah."

I watch him walk toward the boys' dorms. For the first time in three years, I wonder what Ethan Wallace's life looks like when no one's watching.

Then I shake off the thought and head to my dorm.

We compromised tonight. Found neutral ground. Might actually be able to do this.

It doesn't mean we're friends.

But maybe we don't have to be enemies.
