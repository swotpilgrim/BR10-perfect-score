# Chapter 19: Thanksgiving Realization

The bus from Cambridge Prep to Worcester took three hours on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving—stop-and-go traffic through Massachusetts with half the school traveling home.

My mother was waiting at the station, double-parked with hazards flashing. I tossed my duffel bag in the backseat and slid into the passenger seat, enveloped in a hug that smelled like the diner—coffee and vanilla and frying oil.

"Look at you," she said. "You look tired."

"Midterms just ended."

"And how did they go?"

"All As."

She laughed. "Modest as ever."

The drive home took fifteen minutes through familiar streets. Our triple-decker apartment building sat on a tree-lined street in a working-class neighborhood. Climbing to the second floor felt like stepping backward in time.

My father was in the kitchen making his famous stuffing—the one with sausage and apples that he only made at Thanksgiving. He dropped his wooden spoon to pull me into a bear hug that lifted me off my feet.

"There's our scholar," he said.

"Hi, Dad."

"Princeton application submitted?"

"Not yet. November first deadline. Still have a week."

"But you're ready?"

"I'm ready."

He studied my face the same way my mother had, looking for signs of stress or exhaustion or whatever parents looked for when their kid came home from boarding school. Whatever he saw must have satisfied him, because he nodded and returned to his stuffing.

That night, I helped my mother prep for Thanksgiving dinner while my father watched football in the living room. We worked in comfortable silence—her peeling potatoes while I chopped celery—falling into rhythms we'd established over seventeen years of shared kitchen time.

"So tell me about school," she said finally. "Really tell me. Not the 'fine, good, all As' version."

I told her about midterms and college applications and Professor Brennan wanting to submit our research paper to an academic journal. I told her about scholarship essays and winter formal planning and Sarah's latest drama with her family. Normal stuff. Safe stuff.

"And what about that boy you mentioned at October break?" she asked, not looking up from her potato peeling. "Ethan?"

I nearly dropped the celery. "I mentioned Ethan?"

"You did. Said he was helping you with your college essays." She glanced at me, expression too knowing. "Is he still helping?"

"We're working together on some projects. The research paper I mentioned. And we review each other's scholarship applications."

"Mm-hmm."

"What does 'mm-hmm' mean?"

"It means you smiled when you said his name."

"I did not."

"You did. A very specific smile." She rinsed a potato and started on the next one. "Is he nice?"

"He's—" I paused, trying to find words that wouldn't reveal too much. "He's really smart. Like, genuinely brilliant, not just good at school. And he's funny, which I didn't expect. And he understands pressure in a way most people don't."

"Sounds like you like him."

"We're friends. Study partners."

My mother made a noncommittal sound that somehow conveyed complete disbelief. "And does this study partner have feelings for you?"

"Mom."

"It's a reasonable question."

"It's complicated."

"Hannah." She set down her peeler and turned to face me fully. "You're seventeen years old and away at boarding school. Nothing about teenage feelings is complicated. It just feels that way because you're in the middle of it."

I thought about Study Room 3B and late-night walks across the quad and the way Ethan had looked at me when he said he didn't care about his Princeton odds if they depended on me failing. "We're applying to the same colleges. Same first choice, same backups. We're competing for the same spots."

"So?"

"So that makes it complicated."

"Does he want you to fail?"

"No. The opposite, actually. He's been helping me strengthen my applications even though it might hurt his own chances."

"And you've been doing the same for him?"

"Yeah."

My mother smiled. "Then it's not complicated at all, sweetheart. You just think it should be."

I finished chopping the celery in silence, thinking about what she'd said. At Cambridge Prep, everything felt weighted with significance—every grade, every college application update, every conversation loaded with implications. But here in our Worcester kitchen, with my mother peeling potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner, it did seem simpler.

Ethan helped me. I helped him. We made each other better. We wanted each other to succeed even when that success might come at our own expense.

When had that stopped being rivalry and started being something else?

Thursday was Thanksgiving—turkey and stuffing and my uncle's terrible jokes. Friday and Saturday I helped serve at the diner, picking up my old apron and falling into familiar rhythms.

Sunday morning I was lying on my bed, supposedly reading ahead for AP Lit but actually staring at my phone, when I admitted what I'd been doing all weekend: waiting for Ethan to text.

He hadn't. Neither had I. We'd agreed—academic emergencies only.

Which was fine. We'd see each other Monday in Study Room 3B and everything would go back to normal.

Except I'd thought about him constantly. I'd seen Princeton merchandise and wondered if he'd submitted his application. I'd been quizzing diner customers on *Gatsby* symbolism in my head, imagining what Ethan would say. I'd found myself mentally narrating observations in his voice—wry, smart, self-deprecating.

This was not normal study partner behavior.

My phone buzzed. I grabbed it embarrassingly fast.

**Ethan:** Academic emergency. Need your opinion on whether this sentence needs a comma.

I smiled despite myself.

**Hannah:** That depends. What's the sentence?

**Ethan:** "My father spent twenty minutes at Thanksgiving dinner explaining why my Princeton deferral will be a personal embarrassment to the Wallace family legacy."

**Hannah:** Definitely needs a comma. After "dinner."

**Ethan:** That's what I thought. Thanks.

A pause. The typing indicator appeared, disappeared, appeared again.

**Ethan:** How's Worcester?

**Hannah:** Quieter than Cambridge Prep. Less stressful. My mom makes better food than the dining hall.

**Ethan:** Low bar.

**Hannah:** Fair point. How's Connecticut?

**Ethan:** About as fun as expected. My sister asked if I have a girlfriend. My father asked if I've scheduled my Princeton alumni interview. My mother asked if I'm eating enough.

**Hannah:** Are you eating enough?

**Ethan:** That's not the point.

**Hannah:** What is the point?

**Ethan:** The point is I've spent four days at my family's estate being interrogated about my college prospects and somehow all I can think about is whether you've finished your scholarship essays.

I stared at that message for a long time. Read it three times. Tried to find a casual, friendship-appropriate response that didn't reveal the sudden acceleration of my heartbeat.

**Hannah:** I finished two of them. The third is being difficult.

**Ethan:** Want to work on it tomorrow? When we're back?

**Hannah:** Monday session, seven PM?

**Ethan:** Can't wait.

I set my phone down and lay back on my bed, staring at the ceiling of my childhood bedroom with its glow-in-the-dark stars I'd put up in sixth grade. Can't wait. Was that normal study partner language? Was any of this normal?

"Hannah!" my mother called from downstairs. "Dinner in twenty minutes!"

"Coming!"

I rolled off my bed and caught my reflection in the mirror above my dresser. I was smiling. The specific smile my mother had noticed, apparently.

Downstairs, my parents were setting the table for a quiet Sunday dinner—just the three of us, leftover turkey transformed into my father's famous pot pie. I helped carry plates and silverware, falling into familiar patterns.

"You seem happy," my father observed as we sat down.

"I'm home for Thanksgiving. Why wouldn't I be happy?"

"You've been checking your phone every five minutes all weekend."

"I have not."

My mother and father exchanged a look that contained an entire conversation.

"What?" I demanded.

"Nothing," my mother said, too innocently. "Just noticing that you seem eager to get back to school."

"I have work to do. Scholarship essays, the journal submission—"

"And that study partner you mentioned," my father added.

"His name is Ethan," my mother supplied.

"Ah, yes. Ethan." My father served himself pot pie. "The one who understands pressure."

I was going to die of embarrassment in my parents' dining room. "Can we please talk about literally anything else?"

"Of course," my mother said. "How about that Princeton application? All ready to submit?"

I survived dinner through sheer force of will and escaped upstairs afterward, citing homework. My phone buzzed again as I was attempting to focus on AP Lit.

**Ethan:** Still dealing with that difficult scholarship essay?

**Hannah:** Attempting to. Mostly failing. You?

**Ethan:** Supposed to be writing my Yale supplemental essay. Actually researching commute times between New Haven and Princeton.

I sat with that for a moment. New Haven to Princeton. Yale to Princeton. Why would he be researching that unless—

**Hannah:** Why?

**Ethan:** Purely academic interest.

**Hannah:** You're a terrible liar.

**Ethan:** Fine. Because if I end up at Yale and you're at Princeton, I want to know how often I can visit.

My heart did something complicated in my chest. I typed and deleted three different responses before settling on:

**Hannah:** It's about an hour and a half by train.

**Ethan:** That's manageable.

**Hannah:** Very manageable.

**Ethan:** Good to know.

We texted for another hour about nothing important—AP Lit homework, Thanksgiving food, whether Heathcliff was irredeemable or just misunderstood. Normal stuff, except it didn't feel normal. It felt significant in a way I couldn't quite articulate.

Finally, close to midnight:

**Ethan:** I should let you sleep. See you tomorrow?

**Hannah:** Tomorrow. Seven PM.

**Ethan:** I'll be the one who missed Study Room 3B more than is reasonable.

**Hannah:** I'll be the other one.

I put my phone on my nightstand and turned out the light, but I didn't sleep for a long time. I lay in the dark thinking about Ethan researching train schedules and telling his sister he didn't have a girlfriend and texting me about comma placement when we'd agreed on academic emergencies only.

I thought about the way I'd smiled when my mother mentioned his name.

I thought about how the best part of Thanksgiving break had been a text conversation about nothing.

And I thought about my mother's words: Nothing about teenage feelings is complicated. It just feels that way because you're in the middle of it.

Maybe she was right.

Maybe this wasn't complicated at all.

Maybe I'd just been afraid to admit that somewhere between Study Room 3B and college application reviews and late-night conversations about anxiety and pressure, Ethan Wallace had stopped being my rival and started being the person I couldn't stop thinking about.

The person I missed after five days apart.

The person whose success mattered as much as my own.

The person I wanted to see more than I wanted almost anything.

Simple, really.

Terrifying, definitely.

But not complicated.

Not anymore.
