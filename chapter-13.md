# Chapter 13: The Wallace Name

Friday evening. November cold has settled over campus, frost forming on the library windows. Six weeks into our collaboration. Two weeks remaining in Dr. Morrison's mandate.

Ethan and I are working through his Yale supplemental essay—he's written about family legacy and expectation, circling the truth without quite landing on it—when someone knocks on Study Room 3B's door.

A student worker pokes her head in. "Ethan Wallace? Phone call for you. Hallway pay phone."

Ethan's expression shifts. Not surprised, exactly. More like resigned. "Be right there."

The student worker leaves. Ethan stands, gathering himself in a way that looks practiced. Like he's putting on armor.

"Sorry. I'll be quick." He steps into the hallway, leaving the door slightly ajar.

I return to my laptop, trying to focus on my Princeton early decision application checklist. But the pay phone is mounted just outside our study room, and voices carry through the half-open door.

I don't mean to eavesdrop. But Ethan's voice drifts in, tight and careful in a way I've never heard.

"Yes, sir. I submitted Princeton early decision two days ago."

Silence. His father talking.

"Yes. Essays are strong. Dr. Morrison wrote the recommendation. My grades are—yes. 4.0 unweighted."

Another pause. Longer.

"I'm confident about my application." Ethan's voice is steady, practiced. "The collaboration project with Hannah Price will strengthen the letter. Dr. Morrison specifically mentioned partnership skills as important for our recommendations."

I freeze at my name. Keep staring at my laptop screen without seeing it.

"No, I understand the stakes." Something in Ethan's tone makes my chest tight. "Three generations of Wallace men at Princeton. I'm aware I'd be the first to break tradition if I don't get in."

My stomach drops.

"Father, I—" Ethan stops. Listening. When he speaks again, his voice is quieter. "I know Grandfather endowed the library wing. I know Uncle James serves on the alumni board. I'm not taking the legacy lightly."

I should close the door. Give him privacy. But my hands won't move.

"Yes, sir. December fifteenth, the decision comes. I'll—" Pause. "Yes. I know what's expected. I won't disappoint you."

The finality in those last four words makes me hurt for him.

"Love you too. Tell Mother I'll call Sunday."

The click of the phone returning to its cradle. Silence.

I quickly look down at my laptop, pretending I wasn't listening. But when Ethan returns to Study Room 3B, I can't maintain the pretense. He looks pale. Actually pale, like someone drained blood from his face. He sits down heavily, not meeting my eyes.

We sit in silence for thirty seconds that feel much longer.

"Are you okay?" I finally ask.

"Fine." The lie is transparent. "Just my father checking on applications."

"Ethan."

He looks up. Our eyes meet. I see exhaustion there, bone-deep and familiar.

"You don't have to pretend with me," I say quietly. "Remember? That was the deal."

Ethan's careful facade cracks slightly. He leans back in his chair, rubbing his face with both hands. "My father doesn't know about the anxiety. Or the medication. Or the panic attacks I had sophomore year that sent me to the campus health center at two AM."

I wait. Let him talk.

"Wallace men are surgeons. Lawyers. Senators. My grandfather performed cardiac surgery for forty years. My father is chief of surgery at Boston General. My uncle James argued a case before the Supreme Court." Ethan's voice is flat, reciting facts. "Wallace men don't have anxiety disorders. We don't take SSRIs. We don't see therapists because we can't handle pressure."

"But you do handle pressure," I point out. "You're ranked first in our class. You're applying to Princeton early decision. You're managing all of this while dealing with anxiety that no one acknowledges."

"That's the problem. I'm managing despite the anxiety, which means I should be able to manage without it." He laughs, bitter. "If I were a proper Wallace, I wouldn't need medication to function. I'd just... be excellent. Effortlessly."

The word effortless lands hard. His whole facade—the casual brilliance, the easy success—is performance hiding the reality that nothing about this is easy for him.

"Does your father know you're in therapy?"

"God, no. I tell him I'm at Academic Bowl practice." Ethan's smile doesn't reach his eyes. "Thursday afternoons, every week for two years. He thinks I'm preparing for competitions. I'm actually sitting in Dr. Chen's office learning breathing exercises for panic attacks."

I think about Wednesday nights busing tables. My parents know I work. They're proud of it.

But Ethan hides his therapy like it's shameful. Different kind of invisibility.

"The Princeton legacy," I say carefully. "Three generations. That's a lot of pressure."

"It's not just pressure. It's... inevitability. Wallace men go to Princeton. We major in molecular biology or political science. We attend medical school or law school. We marry well, have children, continue the tradition." Ethan's recitation is mechanical. "I've known my path since I was seven years old. Princeton undergrad, Yale medical school like my father, cardiothoracic surgery residency, position at a prestigious hospital."

"Do you want to be a surgeon?"

The question seems to surprise him. "Want?"

"Yes. Want. Do you actually want to spend your life doing cardiac surgery?"

Ethan is silent for a long moment. "I don't know. I've never asked myself that question because it's not relevant. Want doesn't factor into Wallace family planning."

"That sounds suffocating."

"It is." He says it simply, matter-of-fact. "But at least it's certain. I know exactly what's expected. There's a clear path, and if I follow it perfectly, I won't disappoint anyone."

"Except maybe yourself."

"My self is less important than family legacy."

The casual way he dismisses his own desires makes me angry. "That's bullshit."

Ethan looks startled. I don't usually swear.

"You're a person, not a dynasty continuation project. Your father should care whether you're happy, not just maintaining tradition."

"Says the scholarship student whose parents sacrificed everything so she could attend Cambridge Prep." Ethan's tone isn't cruel, just pointing out the parallel. "You're carrying their dreams too. We're both performing for family expectations."

He's not wrong. But there's a difference I can't quite articulate.

"My parents want me to succeed because they think education will give me opportunities they never had," I say slowly. "They want me to be happy and secure. Your father wants you to be a specific kind of successful. To fit a predetermined mold."

"Maybe. But the weight feels the same, doesn't it? Knowing you can't fail because people are depending on you."

"Yeah," I admit. "It does."

We sit with that shared understanding. Two people carrying different versions of impossible expectations, recognizing the exhaustion in each other.

"At least your success is actually yours," Ethan says quietly. "You earned your place through merit. If you get into Princeton, it's because you're brilliant, not because your grandfather's name is on a library wing."

"And everything you achieve gets attributed to family connections rather than ability," I counter. "You're ranked first because you're exceptional, not because you're a Wallace."

"Try telling that to Jennifer Campbell. Or half the student body."

"I'm telling you." I lean forward. "You're one of the smartest people I've ever met. Your Morrison analysis was insightful. Your editing made my writing better. Managing anxiety while succeeding doesn't diminish your abilities—it makes them more impressive."

Ethan is very still. "You really believe that."

"Obviously. I wouldn't say it otherwise."

"Most people think anxiety is weakness. That needing medication means you're not strong enough to handle normal life."

"Most people are wrong. Anxiety is a medical condition, not a character flaw. And managing it while maintaining a 4.0 and competing for valedictorian is strength, not weakness."

Something in Ethan's expression shifts. The careful walls lower slightly. "Thank you," he says quietly. "For understanding. And not... judging."

"You didn't judge me about application fees or exhaustion. Why would I judge you for anxiety?"

"Because it's different. Your struggles are legitimate—financial pressure, work schedule. Mine are privileged problems. Poor little rich boy can't handle expectations."

"Stop." My voice is sharp. "Pain isn't a competition. Your anxiety is real. Your family pressure is real. Financial privilege doesn't make your struggles invalid."

Ethan looks at me like I've said something profound instead of obvious.

"We're different," I continue. "Our challenges are different. But we're both drowning in expectations and performing perfect facades to hide how hard we're working to stay afloat. That's... similar enough."

"Similar enough for what?"

"For understanding each other. For not pretending in here." I gesture at Study Room 3B. "You said I could be exhausted-Hannah instead of perfect-Hannah. Same goes both ways. You can be anxious-Ethan instead of effortless-genius-Wallace-legacy-Ethan."

"That's a lot of hyphens."

"You have a lot of facades."

He laughs, real and surprised. "Fair point."

The tension eases. We return to essay work, but something's changed. Ethan's shoulders are less rigid. His hands don't shake when he types.

At eight-thirty, we've made solid progress on his Yale supplemental. The essay is more honest now—acknowledging that family legacy creates both opportunity and expectation.

"This is better," Ethan says, rereading the revised version. "More truthful."

"Colleges want authentic voices. This is yours."

We pack up as the library's nine o'clock warning echoes through the building.

Walking out, I think about the phone call. Ethan's father checking on Princeton, reminding him of three generations of tradition, never knowing his son takes medication just to survive the pressure.

At the path split, we pause.

"I think you'd be an excellent surgeon. Or lawyer. Or whatever you actually want to be, which might be neither of those things."

Ethan smiles slightly. "I don't know what I want. I've spent so long following the plan that I've never considered alternatives."

"Maybe that's something to think about. After applications are done."

"Maybe."

We stand in the November cold, neither ready to separate.

"Your father's wrong," I add. "Not getting into Princeton wouldn't make you the first Wallace to break tradition. It would make you the first to forge your own path. That's not failure. That's courage."

Ethan looks at me with something I can't quite name.

"Thank you, Hannah. For listening. And for not making this weird."

"We're partners. That's what partners do."

"Academic partners."

"Right. Academic."

The word feels insufficient for whatever we're becoming. But neither of us names it.

"See you Monday," Ethan says.

"Seven PM. Same study room."

"Wouldn't miss it."

He walks toward Thoreau Hall. I watch him go, thinking about cages made of privilege and expectation.

Ethan defended me against Jennifer's cruelty. Tonight, I defended him against his own shame.

We're not just collaborating anymore.

We're seeing each other—past facades to the exhausted, imperfect people underneath.

That feels more intimate than any academic partnership should be.
