# Chapter 25: Study Room Confessions

Seven PM found me sitting in Study Room 3B with my laptop open but no work actually happening. I'd been staring at the same calculus problem for twenty minutes, unable to focus on anything except the conversation Ethan and I were about to have.

He arrived at 7:03, which was unusual—Ethan was always punctual. He looked as nervous as I felt.

"Hey," he said, dropping his bag on the table.

"Hey."

We sat in our usual spots across from each other, the table between us suddenly feeling like both too much distance and not enough. Neither of us opened our laptops.

"So," Ethan said finally. "We should talk."

"We should."

"About this morning. About what I was trying to say before the bell rang."

My heart was pounding. "Okay."

Ethan took a breath. "Hannah, I need to be honest with you about something I've been trying to figure out how to say for weeks. Maybe months."

"Okay," I said again, because apparently that was the only word my brain could produce.

"You asked this morning what matters," he continued. "And I said this—us, Study Room 3B, working together. But that's not the whole truth. It's not just the partnership or the collaboration or even the friendship, though those things are all incredible."

He paused, and I waited, barely breathing.

"It's you," Ethan said quietly. "You matter. Not valedictorian Hannah or scholarship student Hannah or any of the roles you play. Just... you. The person who argues with me about Heathcliff and helps me write letters to Princeton and makes me laugh when I'm stressed. The person who saw through all my performative effortless brilliance and called me on my bullshit. The person who makes everything—everything—better just by existing in my life."

I stared at him, unable to form words.

"And I know this might ruin the partnership we've built," Ethan continued, words coming faster now like he needed to get them all out before losing courage. "I know it's complicated with college decisions pending and graduation coming and the fact that we were rivals for three years before we were anything else. But I can't keep pretending this is just about studying together or being friends. Because somewhere between Dr. Morrison forcing us into collaboration and now, I fell in love with you. And I needed you to know that."

The silence that followed felt enormous. Through the window, I could see snow starting to fall—the first snowfall of the year, coming down in fat flakes that caught the exterior lights.

"Say something," Ethan said, voice rough. "Please. Even if it's just to tell me I ruined everything."

I found my voice. "You didn't ruin everything."

"No?"

"No, because—" I stopped, gathering courage. "Because I fell in love with you too. Probably around Thanksgiving, maybe earlier. I've been terrified to admit it because I didn't want to complicate the partnership. But the partnership is already complicated, because every time you text me my heart does this stupid flutter thing, and I spend our study sessions half-focused on calc and half-focused on how your hair sticks up when you've been running your hands through it, and I couldn't celebrate getting into Princeton because all I cared about was whether you were okay."

Ethan's expression transformed. "Really?"

"Really. I love you, Ethan. Not salutatorian Ethan or Wallace family legacy Ethan. Just you. The person who's honest about anxiety and perfectionism. Who makes me laugh. Who helped me believe I belong at Cambridge Prep. Who researches train schedules between Yale and Princeton just in case."

"You know about that?"

"You mentioned it over Christmas break."

"I was hoping you'd forgotten."

"I didn't forget anything about our conversations." I leaned forward. "Ethan, losing valedictorian to you wouldn't have bothered me. Losing you would have destroyed me. That's when I knew this was more than friendship or partnership. When your happiness mattered more than my class rank."

He stood up, walking around the table to my side. I stood too, and suddenly we were close enough that I could count the flecks of gold in his eyes.

"Can I kiss you?" Ethan asked softly, his voice barely above a whisper.

"Please."

The kiss was soft and certain and somehow inevitable—like everything between us had been building to this exact moment since that very first mandated study session six months ago when we'd sat across this same table as reluctant rivals. His hands cupped my face gently, reverently, and I reached up to tangle my fingers in his perpetually disheveled hair. It was perfect in its simplicity, perfect in its rightness.

When we pulled apart, we were both smiling like idiots.

"That was—" Ethan started.

"Yeah," I agreed.

We sat down again, but this time on the same side of the table, close enough that our shoulders touched. The calculus homework I'd been pretending to work on sat forgotten on my laptop screen.

"So what now?" I asked.

"Now we figure it out together." Ethan took my hand, lacing our fingers together. "Princeton might accept me in regular decision, or I might end up at Yale. You'll be at Princeton regardless. That's a challenge, but it's manageable."

"An hour and a half by train."

"You did research too?"

"Obviously."

He smiled. "We'll make it work. Long distance for a year if we have to, then hopefully the same campus after that. And even if geography is complicated, this—" He gestured between us. "—this isn't. This is the simplest thing in my life right now."

"Sarah said the same thing. That I was overcomplicated something straightforward."

"Sarah's smart."

"She is." I leaned my head on his shoulder. "I can't believe Dr. Morrison's forced collaboration mandate led to this."

"She's going to be insufferably smug when she finds out."

"When, not if?"

"Hannah, we're going to be terrible at hiding this. I've been in love with you for months and barely managed to keep it under wraps. Now that I can actually hold your hand and kiss you? Everyone's going to know within a week."

He was probably right. But I didn't care.

We sat in Study Room 3B—the room that had been our battleground, our sanctuary, the place where we'd gone from rivals to partners to something more—and I felt more certain about this than I'd felt about anything in four years of perfect grades.

"We should probably actually study," I said eventually. "We have calc homework."

"Probably." But neither of us moved to open our laptops.

"Or we could just sit here and acknowledge that this is really happening."

"I like that option better."

So we did. We sat in Study Room 3B holding hands while snow fell outside, talking about everything and nothing. About spring semester plans and regular decision stress and how we were going to tell our friends. About whether Professor Brennan would be surprised or whether he'd seen this coming. About graduation speeches and prom plans and all the normal things couples discussed.

Because we were a couple now.

Hannah and Ethan. Not rivals. Not just study partners.

Together.

At nine PM when the library closed, we walked across the quad hand in hand. The snow had accumulated enough to crunch under our feet, and the campus looked transformed—white and clean and peaceful.

At the fork in the path between Whitman and Thoreau, we stopped.

"I don't want to say good night," Ethan admitted.

"Then don't. Say see you tomorrow."

"See you tomorrow, Hannah."

"See you tomorrow, Ethan."

He kissed me again—brief and sweet—before heading toward his dorm. I watched him go, then practically floated back to Whitman Hall.

Sarah took one look at my face and started laughing.

"You told him."

"He told me first, actually."

"And?"

"And we're together. Like, actually together. Kissing and everything."

Sarah pulled me into a hug. "About damn time. I've been watching you two dance around this for months."

I hugged her back, grinning so hard my face hurt. "It's real, Sarah. He loves me."

"Of course he loves you. That's been obvious since November."

"But now I know it. He said it out loud."

"What did you say?"

"That I love him too."

Sarah pulled back, eyes suspiciously shiny. "Hannah Price, academic perfectionist and emotional disaster, finally admitting she has feelings. I'm so proud."

I laughed. "Disaster is harsh."

"But accurate."

She wasn't wrong.

I got ready for bed thinking about Ethan's hands cupping my face, his certainty that we'd figure out the distance, his smile when I said I loved him too. Three months ago, he'd been my rival. The person I needed to beat to prove I belonged at Cambridge Prep.

Now he was the person who made me feel like I belonged everywhere.

The perfect score wasn't valedictorian after all.

It was this.

It was him.

It was us.
