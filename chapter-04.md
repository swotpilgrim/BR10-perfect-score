# Chapter 4: The Mandate

I make it halfway across the quad before the reality of what just happened hits me like a physical weight.

Six weeks. Forced collaboration. With Ethan Wallace.

My feet slow, then stop completely. Students stream past me—heading to clubs, to the library, to dorms—while I stand frozen on the brick pathway, trying to process the impossible situation Dr. Morrison just trapped me in.

It's not fair. I've worked so hard, done everything right, maintained perfect grades while working three nights a week and leading three clubs. I've sacrificed social life, sleep, any semblance of normal teenage existence, all to earn my place here and secure my future. And now Dr. Morrison is forcing me to collaborate with my direct competition, to help improve the applications of the one person standing between me and valedictorian.

How is that fair?

"Hannah?"

I blink. Sarah is standing in front of me, concern written across her face.

"You okay? You look like you've seen a ghost."

"Dr. Morrison—" My voice cracks. I swallow hard, try again. "Dr. Morrison is making me work with Ethan Wallace."

Sarah's eyebrows shoot up. "What?"

"Six weeks. Three times a week. Joint research project and helping each other with college essays. She says we lack collaborative experience and our applications are incomplete without it." The words tumble out too fast. "She's holding our recommendation letters hostage until we prove we can work together as equals instead of competitors."

"Okay." Sarah links her arm through mine, starts walking us toward Whitman Hall. "Let's get you back to your room and you can explain this from the beginning."

---

My dorm room has never felt smaller. I pace the narrow space between my bed and desk while Sarah sits cross-legged on my desk chair, listening to me rant.

"She showed us this spreadsheet. Our applications side by side. Identical GPAs, nearly identical test scores, same extracurriculars. We're mirror images. And apparently that means we're both incomplete candidates because neither of us has genuine partnership experience." I spin around, pace back the other direction. "Partnership experience. Like that's some required skill I should have developed while maintaining perfect grades and working to afford textbooks."

"Hannah—"

"And Ethan." I practically spit his name. "Of all people, she pairs me with him. My direct competitor for valedictorian, for Princeton, for everything. She says working together raises both our applications instead of making one stronger than the other, but how can I trust that? What if he sabotages my essays? What if he takes credit for our joint project?"

"Did he say he would?"

I stop pacing. "What?"

"When you left Dr. Morrison's office, did Ethan say he was going to sabotage you or take unfair credit?"

"No," I admit. "He said he wasn't sabotaging my applications and I said I wasn't sabotaging his. But—"

"But you don't trust him," Sarah finishes.

"He's my rival."

"He's also Dr. Morrison's favorite student. He's not going to risk his Princeton recommendation by sabotaging you." Sarah spins slightly in the chair. "And honestly? Dr. Morrison has a point. When was the last time you worked with someone as an actual equal?"

"I work with people constantly."

"You work above people. You delegate. You organize. You're amazing at it, but that's not the same as partnership." Sarah's tone is gentle but firm. "I've been your roommate for two years before you got the single. I've watched you do group projects. You take over. You can't help it. You see the most efficient path to an A and you make sure everyone follows it."

My face heats. "That's not— I just want things done right."

"I know. And that's a valuable skill. But Dr. Morrison isn't wrong that you need to learn how to work with someone without being in charge." Sarah tilts her head. "And honestly? Six weeks of forced collaboration might be good for you."

"Whose side are you on?"

"Yours. Always yours. Which is why I'm telling you the truth instead of what you want to hear."

I sink onto my bed, suddenly exhausted. "Six weeks feels impossible. Thirty-six hours minimum with Ethan Wallace."

"First session Friday, right?"

"Seven PM. Study Room 3B."

"So you have two days to mentally prepare." Sarah stands, comes to sit beside me on the bed. "And hey, maybe it won't be completely terrible. You did say he defended you against Jennifer that one time."

"That doesn't make us friends."

"No, but it means he's not completely heartless. He saw Jennifer being cruel and shut her down. That's worth something."

I lean my head on Sarah's shoulder. "I hate this."

"I know."

"I hate that Dr. Morrison is right."

"I know that too."

We sit in silence for a moment. Outside my window, the October afternoon is fading into evening. The quad is quieter now, most students at dinner or evening activities.

"I'm scared," I admit quietly. "What if I can't do it? What if I'm so bad at actual collaboration that I fail and Dr. Morrison writes that in her recommendation?"

"You won't fail," Sarah says with certainty. "You've never failed at anything academic in your life. You're going to approach this like every other challenge—methodically, carefully, and with way more preparation than necessary."

"And if Ethan and I kill each other before six weeks are up?"

"Then I'll help you hide the body. That's what friends are for."

A surprised laugh escapes me. "Thanks."

"Anytime." Sarah squeezes my shoulder. "Now, have you eaten?"

"No."

"Come on. Dinner, then you can plan out your entire six-week collaboration schedule in fifteen-minute increments like I know you're dying to do."

She's not wrong.

---

That night, after dinner and Sarah's return to her own room, I pull out my planner.

Six weeks. Three sessions weekly. That's eighteen total sessions, thirty-six hours minimum.

I flip to Friday, October 12th. Write: *Study Room 3B, 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM. Ethan collaboration session 1.*

Monday, October 15th: *Study Room 3B, 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM. Session 2.*

Wednesday, October 17th: *Session 3.*

I continue mapping it out. Fridays, Mondays, and Wednesdays—Dr. Morrison's predetermined schedule. The sessions slot into the gaps in my existing commitments like unwelcome puzzle pieces. Friday evenings I usually use for essay writing. Monday and Wednesday evenings for SAT prep and college application work.

All of it now shared with Ethan.

I stare at the marked calendar pages. Six weeks suddenly looks very long.

My phone buzzes. A text from an unknown number.

*This is Ethan. Dr. Morrison gave me your number. We should probably figure out a research topic before Friday. -EW*

I stare at the message for a full minute. The formality of it—the sign-off with his initials like it's a business email. The practical acknowledgment that we need to prepare.

He's right, though. Walking into Friday's session without a plan means wasting time we'll both resent spending.

I text back: *Agreed. Do you have topic ideas?*

The response comes quickly: *A few. Should we meet before Friday to discuss?*

My immediate instinct is to say no. The mandate is three sessions weekly—any additional time feels like surrendering to this situation.

But that's childish. If we're being forced to do this, we might as well do it efficiently.

*Thursday after classes? 4:00 PM at library?*

*Works for me. See you then.*

I save his number in my contacts. Ethan Wallace. My rival. My forced collaboration partner.

For six weeks, at least.

I turn back to my planner, but the neat schedule I've mapped out doesn't make me feel better the way planning usually does. This isn't a challenge I can simply organize my way through. This requires actual trust, actual partnership, actual vulnerability.

Three things I'm terrible at.

Across campus in Thoreau Hall, Ethan Wallace is having a similar crisis.

I don't know this yet—won't know until much later—but at the moment I'm texting him, he's sitting at his desk with his head in his hands while Ryan sits on his bed, watching with concern.

"She's forcing you to work with Hannah Price," Ryan says, still processing. "For six weeks."

"Three sessions a week. Two hours minimum. Joint project and essay collaboration." Ethan's voice is muffled through his hands. "Dr. Morrison basically said our recommendations would be incomplete without it."

"That's... actually kind of smart. You and Hannah are both brilliant but neither of you plays well with others."

Ethan lifts his head enough to glare at Ryan. "Not helping."

"I'm serious. You run Academic Decathlon like a drill sergeant. Hannah does the same with her teams. You're both so focused on individual achievement that you've never learned to actually collaborate."

"Because we're competing for the same things. Valedictorian. Princeton. Everything."

"And that competition has made you both kind of isolated." Ryan leans back against the wall. "When was the last time you worked on something with someone where you weren't in charge or competing?"

Ethan opens his mouth. Closes it. Frowns.

"Exactly," Ryan says. "Dr. Morrison found your weak spot. And Hannah's."

"This is going to be a disaster."

"Maybe. Or maybe you'll both learn something."

"What, that we can hate each other more efficiently through proximity?"

"That you're not that different." Ryan shrugs. "You're both under insane pressure. You both work yourselves to exhaustion. You both define your worth through academic achievement. Seems like you'd understand each other better than anyone else at this school."

"Understanding her doesn't change that she's my competition."

"No, but it might change how you compete." Ryan's expression turns serious. "You're destroying yourself trying to maintain this effortless genius image while having panic attacks in your dorm room. Maybe working with someone who actually understands the pressure—who's honest about how hard they work—would be good for you."

Ethan doesn't have an answer to that.

His phone buzzes with my text. He reads it, types back, and stares at the screen after I respond.

"She wants to meet Thursday to plan," he tells Ryan.

"See? Practical. Efficient. You already have that in common."

"We have academic neurosis in common. That's not a foundation for partnership."

"It's a start," Ryan says.

Ethan isn't convinced. But when he pulls out his own planner—digital, color-coded by subject—and adds the Thursday meeting and six weeks of Friday-Monday-Wednesday sessions, the schedule looks slightly less terrifying than expected.

Slightly.

He texts his father that applications are progressing well. Doesn't mention the forced collaboration or Dr. Morrison's assessment of his incomplete candidacy. His father doesn't need more reasons to question whether Ethan is really Wallace material.

That night, neither Ethan nor I sleep well.

We're both planning, preparing, building defensive strategies for a collaboration neither of us wants but both of us need.

Friday is three days away.

It feels like three days until execution.
