# Chapter 11: Essay Surgery

Monday evening, and we're both bringing revised Princeton essays. The vulnerable versions. The honest ones.

I arrive at Study Room 3B with a knot of anxiety in my stomach. Sharing the original draft was hard enough. This version—where I actually describe what it feels like to serve dinner to classmates, where I detail my parents' exhaustion—feels like exposing a wound.

Ethan's already there, laptop open, staring at his screen with an expression I recognize: the moment before you hit send on something terrifying.

"Ready to trade?" he asks without looking up.

"As ready as I'll ever be."

We exchange revised essays. I open his document and start reading.

The new version is devastating. Ethan writes about sitting in a bathroom stall during a chess tournament, hands shaking so badly he can't hold his phone steady to text Ryan. He describes taking his anxiety medication with water from the sink, counting breaths—in for four, hold for seven, out for eight—while teammates wonder where he disappeared to. He writes about walking back into the tournament room with his hands steadied and his expression composed, and how that performance is more exhausting than the actual chess match.

He describes his father's phone calls asking if he's confident about Princeton, and Ethan's "yes" while he's literally having a panic attack. The paragraph about Wallace legacy—three generations of successful men who made it look easy—and his terror that he's the weak link who'll break the chain.

The essay is raw and real and utterly compelling.

When I finish reading, I look up to find Ethan watching me, waiting for verdict.

"This is brave," I say.

"This is terrifying."

"Same thing, probably." I pull the laptop toward me so we can both see. "But it works. The specificity makes it real. Princeton will read hundreds of essays about overcoming challenges. They won't read many this honest about ongoing struggle."

"You don't think it sounds weak? That I'm still dealing with panic attacks senior year?"

"I think it sounds human. And the contrast between the bathroom stall and walking back into the tournament with composed confidence—that's powerful. It shows strength without claiming you're cured."

Ethan exhales slowly. "Okay. What about yours?"

I pull up my revised essay on his laptop. The new version includes everything I said Friday about serving classmates dinner—the humiliation, the invisibility. I describe my father's construction-callused hands and my mother's exhaustion. I write about calculating application fees down to the dollar and applying for every waiver I can find. About the terror that one B+, one missed scholarship deadline, one moment of not-quite-perfect means failing my parents and myself.

Ethan reads in silence. I watch his face, trying to gauge reaction.

"This is you," he says finally. "The real you, not the perfect-Hannah facade you show everyone."

"Is that good or bad?"

"It's honest. Which is what Princeton actually wants." He scrolls to a paragraph. "This section about serving dinner—it's powerful. But you're still holding back slightly. You write 'I clear plates for students who don't see me as their peer.' Make it more specific. Name the feeling."

"Shame," I say quietly. "It feels like shame. Like I'm less-than because I need the money and they don't."

"Write that. The shame and the resentment and the fact that you keep showing up anyway because you need the income." Ethan highlights another section. "And here, where you talk about your parents' sacrifices. You describe their jobs but not how that makes you feel."

"Guilty. Responsible. Like if I don't succeed perfectly, I'm wasting everything they've given up for me."

"That. That's the emotional truth the essay needs."

For the next hour, we trade the laptop back and forth, adding emotional specificity to both essays. I help Ethan articulate the loneliness of maintaining a facade—how isolating it is to pretend everything's effortless when you're barely holding together. He helps me name the complicated feelings of gratitude and guilt around my parents' sacrifices.

"This sentence feels off," Ethan says, highlighting one of my paragraphs. "'I'm grateful for their support but aware of the cost.' Too distant. You're describing feelings instead of feeling them on the page."

I rewrite: "I'm grateful for their support and crushed by the cost—the weight of their exhaustion that I carry with me into every exam, every assignment, every moment I can't afford to fail."

"Better. You're in it now instead of observing it."

"Your conclusion," I point out. "You write 'I've learned to manage anxiety while maintaining academic excellence.' That's back to clinical distance. End with the human truth."

Ethan thinks, then types: "I still have panic attacks. I still take medication, still excuse myself to bathrooms to breathe through terror. But I also show up, compete, lead, achieve—not despite the anxiety but with it. That's the real Wallace standard: not effortless success but honest effort."

"Perfect. That's exactly what you needed."

By eight o'clock, both essays are significantly stronger. More vulnerable, more specific, more true.

"Dr. Morrison would approve," I say, saving the final versions.

"Dr. Morrison would say we're finally being honest about collaboration requiring emotional investment." Ethan closes his laptop. "These essays don't make us look perfect."

"They make us look real."

"Is that better?"

"I think so. Perfect is boring. Thousands of perfect applicants. But real—actually honest about struggle and fear—that's rarer."

We pack up slowly, neither of us in a hurry to leave. These sessions have become comfortable. Study Room 3B feels less like a cage and more like... neutral ground. Safe space.

"Can I ask you something?" Ethan says.

"You just did."

He gives that small smile I've started recognizing. "When you wrote about serving dinner to classmates—about feeling invisible—was I one of those classmates who didn't see you?"

The question catches me off guard with its directness.

"Yes," I admit. "You sat at the center table. Legacy students. I cleared your plates probably fifty times freshman year. You never looked at me once."

Ethan's expression shifts. "I'm sorry."

"Why? You didn't know."

"That's not an excuse. I should have known. Should have paid attention." He pauses. "I think I didn't see you because seeing you would have meant acknowledging the difference. That I was at the center table because of my last name and you were busing tables despite being smarter than half the students you were serving."

"I wasn't smarter—"

"You were. You are. Your GPA is identical to mine and I know you work exponentially harder for it." Ethan shifts his bag. "I didn't see you freshman year because not seeing you was easier than confronting my privilege."

The honesty lands between us, sharp and uncomfortable.

"And now?" I ask.

"Now I see you. The real you, not just the rival. The person who works three nights weekly and maintains perfect grades and helps her parents with application fees and still shows up at seven PM to make my essays better." He meets my eyes. "I see you, Hannah. And I'm sorry I didn't before."

My throat tightens. "I didn't see you either. I saw the facade—the effortless genius, the legacy student, the person everything came easy for. I didn't see the panic attacks or the pressure or how hard you work to maintain the Wallace standard."

"So we're both guilty of seeing what we expected instead of what was real."

"Yeah. We are."

"And now we're...?"

"Actually seeing each other," I finish.

The silence stretches. Not uncomfortable. Just... weighted with significance.

"I should go," I say finally, even though I don't particularly want to. "I have my dining hall shift at nine."

"Right. Monday evening shift." Ethan knows my schedule now. When did that happen? "I'll walk you."

"You don't have to—"

"I know. I want to."

We leave Study Room 3B and head toward Ashford Dining Hall. The October evening is cold, stars visible between campus buildings. Our breath mists in the air.

"Two more weeks of mandated sessions," Ethan says. "Then we're technically done with Dr. Morrison's collaboration requirement."

"Two weeks," I echo.

"You'll still owe me editing help on your Yale and Columbia essays."

"And you owe me the same."

"So we keep meeting? Even after the mandate ends?"

The question feels loaded with implications I'm not ready to examine.

"For essay work," I say carefully. "Academic collaboration."

"Right. Academic."

But something in his tone suggests he's aware—as I am—that what's happening between us isn't purely academic anymore.

We reach the dining hall entrance. Kitchen noise and food smells drift through the doors. I have fifteen minutes before my shift starts.

"Thanks for the essay feedback," I say. "The emotional specificity made it stronger."

"Thanks for calling out my clinical distance. I needed the push toward honesty."

"That's what collaboration is supposed to do, right? Make us both better."

"Yeah," Ethan says. "Better."

He walks away toward Thoreau Hall, and I head inside to clock in for my shift. As I tie on my apron and start clearing tables, I think about what changed tonight.

We helped each other write better essays. But we also saw each other—really saw each other—maybe for the first time in three years.

Ethan apologizing for not seeing me freshman year. Me admitting I didn't see his struggles.

Both of us acknowledging we're guilty of assumptions and facades and not looking deeper.

And now we're what? Allies? Friends? Something without a name yet?

I clear a table where Jennifer Campbell sits with Student Council friends. She doesn't look at me—I'm still invisible to her, the scholarship student busing plates. But it bothers me less than it used to.

Because at least one person sees me now. Sees the real me, not the perfect-Hannah facade.

And I see him too. The real Ethan beneath the Wallace legacy performance.

That's something. Maybe it's everything.
