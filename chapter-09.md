# Chapter 9: Red Pen Wars

Monday evening, 7:00 PM. I arrive at Study Room 3B with my drafted historical context section—a thousand words of meticulously researched biographical background on Edward Morrison, complete with footnotes and citations.

It's good work. I know it's good work. Thorough, factual, academically rigorous.

Ethan arrives three minutes later with his analysis section on his laptop. We agreed Friday—before the awkwardness about application fees—that we'd trade drafts tonight and edit each other's work.

The idea makes me nervous. Letting someone else critique my writing feels vulnerable in a way that classroom peer review never does. This matters. This is our joint project, our collaboration evidence, our recommendation letter material.

"Ready to trade?" Ethan asks, settling into his usual chair.

"Ready." I send my document to his email. He sends his to mine.

We open the files and start reading in silence.

I read Ethan's opening paragraph once. Then again, slower. Then a third time with growing reluctance to admit what's obvious.

It's brilliant.

His analysis of Morrison's diplomatic correspondence is insightful, well-argued, sophisticated. He identifies patterns I missed—the way Morrison's language shifts when writing to superiors versus peers, the subtle class consciousness underlying his professional communications, the tension between representing American interests and navigating elite European social structures as a former scholarship student.

Ethan writes like someone who genuinely understands the material, not just someone reporting facts. There's interpretation, critical thinking, original analysis. The kind of writing that makes Professor Brennan sit forward in class and say "Now we're getting somewhere."

I hate that it's this good.

I keep reading. His second paragraph builds on the first, tracing Morrison's evolving professional identity through specific letter examples. The writing is clear without being simplistic, analytical without being dry. He quotes the correspondence directly, then explains what the quotes reveal about Morrison's psychological navigation of class barriers.

By the third paragraph, I'm taking notes. Not to critique—to learn.

Across the table, Ethan is reading my section with focused attention. I watch his expression, trying to gauge his reaction. He's not smiling. That could mean anything.

After twenty minutes, we both finish reading. Silence.

"Well?" Ethan says finally.

"Your analysis is good." The admission costs me something. "Really good. The interpretation of Morrison's language patterns is insightful. I hadn't noticed the shifts in formality corresponding to his audience."

"Thank you." Ethan taps his pen against the table. "Your research is thorough. The biographical context is meticulously detailed. You clearly spent significant time verifying facts and establishing timeline."

It's a compliment. I think. But something in his tone suggests there's a "but" coming.

"However?" I prompt.

"However, it's more descriptive than analytical. You're presenting facts—Morrison's background, his path to Cambridge Prep, his education—but not interpreting what those facts mean." Ethan pulls up my document on his laptop, turning it so I can see. "Look at this paragraph. You write: 'Edward Morrison attended Cambridge Preparatory School from 1915-1919 on full scholarship. He excelled academically, graduating valedictorian and gaining acceptance to Yale.' That's factual. But what does it tell us about Morrison's experience? About class dynamics at boarding schools? About how his success was achieved or what it cost him?"

My first instinct is defensive anger. My work is always excellent. I get As on everything I write.

But rereading the paragraph Ethan highlighted, I see what he means. Facts without interpretation. Reporting without analysis.

"I'm establishing context," I say, but it sounds weak even to me.

"You're reciting a biography. Context would explain why these facts matter. Why Morrison's scholarship status shaped his diplomatic career. Why his working-class background made him navigate elite spaces differently." Ethan scrolls down. "You have all the information. You're just not doing anything with it."

The criticism stings. But it's also... accurate.

"Show me," I say.

Ethan highlights another section: "Morrison's mother worked as a seamstress in Worcester, Massachusetts. His father died in 1913. The family struggled financially."

"Okay, now watch." Ethan types quickly, rewriting the passage: "Morrison's mother worked as a seamstress—respectable but precarious work that left the family vulnerable after his father's death in 1913. The Cambridge Prep scholarship didn't just offer education; it offered economic stability and social mobility that Morrison's working-class background couldn't provide. His academic success wasn't just personal achievement—it was family survival."

I stare at the rewritten paragraph. Same facts. Completely different impact.

"You're interpreting the significance instead of just stating the facts," I say slowly.

"Right. Analysis instead of description." Ethan saves the edit. "You're playing it safe. Writing what you know will be factually correct instead of taking interpretive risks."

He's right. And I hate that he's right.

"Fine. Your turn." I pull up his document and scroll to a section I've marked. "This paragraph about Morrison's letter to his mother from Paris. Your interpretation is good, but you're missing historical context that would make your argument stronger. You don't mention that 1923 was post-World War I, that Paris in the twenties had specific political tensions, that Morrison's role at the embassy was directly tied to reparations negotiations. Without that context, your analysis floats without anchor."

Ethan leans closer to read what I'm pointing at. "That context isn't in the letters themselves."

"No, but it's in the historical record. Which is why we're dividing research—I provide context, you provide analysis. But they need to integrate." I start typing, adding two sentences that ground his interpretation in specific historical moment. "See? Now your analysis of Morrison's anxiety about the negotiation has concrete stakes. He's not just nervous about a meeting—he's nervous about participating in politically fraught reparations negotiations that could affect international relations."

Ethan reads my additions. "That does make it stronger."

"Obviously."

The corner of his mouth twitches in almost-smile. "Don't get cocky."

"Says the person whose analysis is making me reconsider my entire approach to research papers."

"Good. You needed to."

We glare at each other, but it's not hostile. It's... almost playful? When did that happen?

For the next two hours, we trade the document back and forth on my laptop, one of us typing while the other watches over their shoulder, both of us editing, arguing, defending our choices, conceding when the other makes a good point.

I rewrite three of my paragraphs to add interpretation. Ethan adds historical context to four of his. I tighten his argument structure. He challenges my safe analysis and pushes me to take actual interpretive positions.

"This sentence is too hedging," Ethan says. "'Morrison's experience possibly suggests potential class barriers.' Possibly? Potentially? Commit to your interpretation."

I revise: "Morrison's experience reveals the persistent class barriers that shaped elite institutions in the 1920s, barriers that formal education could challenge but not erase."

"Better. Actually says something now."

"This paragraph contradicts your previous argument," I counter, highlighting a section. "You can't claim Morrison's diplomatic success proved merit-based advancement worked and then argue in the next paragraph that class barriers remained insurmountable. Pick a position."

Ethan frowns, rereads. "You're right. I'm trying to argue both sides."

"Nuance is fine. Contradiction is sloppy."

He revises, clarifying that Morrison's success was real but limited—individual achievement within systemic barriers, not proof that barriers didn't exist.

By nine o'clock, we've merged our sections into a single coherent paper. The historical context flows naturally into analysis. The analysis grounds itself in specific historical moments. We can't tell who wrote which parts anymore—it's truly collaborative work.

I save the final version and email it to both of us.

"Professor Brennan would actually be impressed by this," I say.

"High praise from Hannah Price."

"I'm serious. This is genuinely good research. The integration of biography and analysis actually works."

Ethan leans back in his chair. "Your research made my analysis possible. The biographical details gave me foundation to interpret from."

"And your analysis showed me what to do with the facts I gathered." I close my laptop. "We actually made each other's work better."

"That's what collaboration is supposed to do."

It's the closest we've come to acknowledging that this partnership might actually be working. Not just fulfilling Dr. Morrison's mandate, but creating something neither of us could have produced alone.

We pack up in comfortable silence. Walking out of the library together is starting to feel normal instead of strange.

"Next session, we should outline our conclusion," Ethan says. "Tie everything together, make final arguments about Morrison's legacy."

"Wednesday works for me."

"See you then."

We part ways at the path split. I watch Ethan walk toward Thoreau Hall, then head to Whitman.

Sarah is in my room when I get back, supposedly studying but actually on her phone.

"How was the study session?" she asks.

"Tolerable."

Sarah looks up, grinning. "That's the nicest thing you've ever said about working with Ethan."

"It was productive. We edited each other's work."

"And?"

"And it was fine. We made the research paper better. That's all."

"You're lying. You look less stressed than you've been in weeks."

I drop my bag on my desk. "I'm not less stressed. I'm still competing for valedictorian, still applying to Princeton, still navigating senior year while working three nights a week. Nothing's changed."

"Except you're not fighting with Ethan anymore."

"We're not fighting. We're collaborating because Dr. Morrison mandated it."

"Uh-huh." Sarah's tone suggests she doesn't believe me. "And the collaboration is going well?"

"Better than expected," I admit. "His analysis is actually good. Really good. And he pushed my research writing to be more interpretive instead of just factual."

"So he made your work better."

"We made each other's work better. That's how collaboration works."

Sarah sets down her phone, giving me full attention. "You like him."

"I respect his analysis skills."

"Hannah."

"We're partners for a research project. That's all."

But Sarah keeps looking at me with that knowing expression, and I turn away to unpack my laptop, ending the conversation.

The truth is, I don't know what Ethan and I are anymore. Not friends—we don't talk about anything except academics. Not enemies—we're actively helping each other succeed. Partners, yes, but something's shifting.

Tonight, watching Ethan challenge my safe writing and push me to take interpretive risks, I felt something unexpected: grateful.

Ethan Wallace makes me better.

And I think maybe I make him better too.

That doesn't change our competition. Doesn't change that we're both applying to Princeton. Doesn't change anything about the rivalry that's defined us for three years.

But it makes the collaboration feel less like a prison sentence and more like... possibility.

Not friendship. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

But definitely not enemies anymore.
