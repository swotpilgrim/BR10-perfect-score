# Chapter 28: After the Ceremony

The graduation reception was held in Ashford Hall—the same room where Dr. Morrison had announced class rankings four months ago. Now it was filled with families, faculty, and seniors celebrating the end of four years.

I stood with Sarah near the refreshment table, still in my cap and gown, holding a cup of punch I wasn't drinking.

"Your speech made me cry," Sarah said. "I'm not even embarrassed about it."

"You were crying?"

"Everyone was crying. Mrs. Chen was full-on sobbing. Even Professor Brennan looked misty."

"I can't believe I actually gave that speech."

"I can. You've been working up to that level of honesty for months." Sarah nudged me. "Ethan's been stopped by approximately seventeen different people congratulating him. You made him Cambridge Prep famous."

I looked across the room where Ethan was indeed surrounded by classmates. He caught my eye and smiled, mouthing "help me."

"I should rescue him," I said.

"You should. But first—" Sarah pulled me into a fierce hug. "Thank you for letting me be part of this journey. For trusting me with your stress and your secrets. For being my friend even when you were too focused on being perfect to have friends."

"Sarah—"

"I'm serious. You're amazing, Hannah. And I'm so proud of you."

I hugged her back, eyes stinging. "I couldn't have survived Cambridge Prep without you."

"I know. I'm essential." She pulled back, grinning. "Now go save your boyfriend from the masses."

I waded through the crowd to Ethan, who was being questioned by Jennifer Campbell about Princeton plans. When he saw me, relief flooded his face.

"Hannah! There you are. Jennifer was just asking about our move-in date."

"Early September," I said, taking his hand. "If you'll excuse us, Jennifer, I need to steal Ethan for family photos."

We escaped to the relative quiet of the hallway outside Ashford Hall.

"Thank you," Ethan said. "She was asking very detailed questions about whether we were requesting to be roommates."

"Are we?"

"Requesting to be roommates? Princeton doesn't do co-ed dorms."

"You know what I mean."

He smiled. "We're requesting the same residential college. Close enough."

Dr. Morrison found us in the hallway, looking pleased with herself.

"Well," she said. "I have to say, forcing you two into collaboration was the best counseling decision I made all year."

"We still think it was manipulative," I said.

"But effective," Ethan added.

"Very effective. That speech was remarkable, Hannah. Honest and moving. Exactly what Cambridge Prep needed to hear." She looked between us. "You both grew tremendously this year. Not just academically—personally. That's what I was hoping for."

"You planned this," I accused. "You knew forcing us together would lead to more than just collaboration skills."

Dr. Morrison's smile was enigmatic. "I knew you had complementary strengths. Hannah's discipline and Ethan's natural ability, combined with both your competitive drives and fear of vulnerability. I hoped that working together might help you both become more complete people. The relationship was a bonus."

"A bonus," Ethan repeated.

"A very satisfying bonus, but still a bonus. The real goal was teaching you that partnership doesn't diminish individual achievement—it enhances it." She squeezed both our shoulders. "You taught each other well. I'm proud of you both."

After she left, Ethan and I looked at each other.

"She definitely planned this," I said.

"One hundred percent. Dr. Morrison is a mastermind."

"And we fell right into her trap."

"Best trap I ever fell into."

I kissed him, right there in the hallway outside Ashford Hall, not caring who might see.

My parents found us eventually, asking for photos on the quad. Ethan's family joined us for a group photo—my mother's idea, and surprisingly, Mr. Wallace agreed without hesitation.

"Come on, everyone together," my mother directed, organizing us in front of the Cambridge Prep seal embedded in the brick pathway. She positioned my father and me on one side, the Wallaces on the other, with Ethan and me in the center.

Two families who'd probably never have met if not for their children's academic rivalry turned partnership. Working-class Worcester and Connecticut old money, brought together by teenagers who'd learned that competition could transform into something better.

"Closer together," the photographer instructed. "You're celebrating, not negotiating a treaty."

Everyone laughed. Ethan pulled me closer, his arm around my waist. Our mothers stood beside us—Linda Price in her best dress from JCPenney, Catherine Wallace in something probably designer that she wore with casual elegance. Our fathers flanked the other side, both slightly awkward in their formal clothes but proud.

"Everyone smile!" the photographer called.

We smiled. My mother was crying happy tears. Ethan's sister Emily made bunny ears behind her brother's head. Mr. Wallace actually cracked a small smile. And in that moment, surrounded by family and accomplishment and the certainty of a shared future, everything felt gloriously, impossibly possible.

"Perfect!" the photographer announced. "I got some great shots."

After the photo session, the families mingled briefly. My mother invited the Wallaces to visit if they were ever in Worcester, which made my father's eyebrows rise slightly—we'd never hosted Connecticut estate people before. But Catherine accepted graciously, saying they'd love to.

"Your daughter is remarkable," Catherine told my parents. "That speech was one of the most honest I've heard at a graduation."

"She gets that from her mother," my father said, smiling at my mom. "Never could keep her thoughts to herself."

They laughed together—genuinely, not the polite laughter of strangers. Maybe our families weren't so different after all. Just people proud of their kids, hoping they'd chosen good partners, wanting them to be happy.

Later, after families had left for graduation dinners at various restaurants and we'd changed out of caps and gowns into regular clothes, Ethan and I walked through campus one last time.

Past Hamilton Hall where we'd had AP Literature with Professor Brennan, where we'd argued about Heathcliff and symbolism and whether romantic heroes could be terrible people. Past the dining hall where we'd sat at separate tables for three years, him with legacy students and chess club, me with scholarship kids and Academic Bowl. Past the oak tree where we'd had so many significant conversations—where he'd first told me I belonged, where we'd stood after the valedictorian announcement.

Finally, inevitably, to Wellington Library and Study Room 3B.

We sat at our table—his side, my side, the space between where so much had changed.

"I'm going to miss this room," I said.

"We'll have new study spots at Princeton."

"It won't be the same."

"No. But it'll be ours." Ethan laced his fingers through mine. "Hannah, I need to say something before we leave Cambridge Prep."

"Okay."

"This year—these seven months—changed my life. Not because I almost got into Princeton or became salutatorian or any of that. Because I found you. Because I learned that being vulnerable isn't weakness. Because I stopped performing and started being real." He paused. "I love you. Not just as my girlfriend or study partner or whatever label we use. I love you as the person who makes me want to be better while accepting me exactly as I am."

My throat felt tight. "I love you too. You made me believe I belonged somewhere not through perfect grades but through genuine connection. You taught me that the perfect score isn't the achievement—it's finding someone who gets it. Who gets me."

"So Princeton together?"

"Princeton together. And everything that comes after."

"Law school?"

"Maybe. Or grad school for me, medical school for you if you decide on that. Whatever we choose."

"As long as we're choosing together."

"Always together."

We sat in Study Room 3B until the library closed, talking about futures and dreams and all the uncertainty ahead. When the announcement came that the library was closing, we packed up slowly—savoring the last moments in the room that had changed everything.

At the door, I looked back one more time. Our table. Our chairs. Our beginning.

"Ready?" Ethan asked.

"Ready."

We walked out of Wellington Library into the June evening, leaving Cambridge Prep behind but taking with us everything we'd learned. About partnership. About vulnerability. About the perfect score that had nothing to do with grades.

Tomorrow, we'd head home to our separate families for the summer. In September, we'd start at Princeton—new campus, new challenges, new chapter.

But tonight, we walked across the Cambridge Prep quad one final time, hand in hand, knowing that whatever came next, we'd face it together.

The perfect score.

Not the grade or the rank or the achievement.

But this.

Us.

Together.

Always.
