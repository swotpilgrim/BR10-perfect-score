# Chapter 21: Picking Up Pieces

I found Ethan in the library the next morning, buried in a stack of books about strengthening deferred college applications. He looked up when I approached, and the circles under his eyes suggested he'd slept about as well as I had.

"Hey," I said, sitting down across from him without asking.

"Hey." He closed the book he'd been reading. "Shouldn't you be celebrating?"

"Not without you."

Something shifted in his expression. "Hannah, you got into Princeton. That's huge. You should be happy."

"I am happy. And also worried about you. Both things can be true." I pulled the book toward me to read the title: *Turning Deferral Into Acceptance: A Strategic Guide*. "How long have you been here?"

"Since six AM."

"Ethan."

"I needed to do something constructive instead of wallowing." He gestured at the stack of books and printouts around him. "So I'm researching. Did you know that about ten percent of deferred students get accepted in the regular decision round? Those aren't terrible odds."

"They're not great odds either."

"No," he admitted. "But they're not zero. And I'm not giving up."

I looked at him—exhausted but determined, already planning his next move instead of giving in to disappointment. This was the Ethan I'd come to know over the past few months. The one who kept pushing forward even when things got hard.

"Okay," I said. "So what's the strategy?"

"What?"

"For turning your deferral into an acceptance. You've been researching all morning. What did you learn?"

Ethan studied my face. "You're going to help me?"

"Of course I'm going to help you. We're partners." I pulled out my laptop. "Plus, I got you into this. Dr. Morrison made us work together, which meant you spent time helping me instead of focusing solely on your own applications. The least I can do is return the favor."

"That's not how it works. You didn't take my acceptance away from me."

"No, but I'm not celebrating mine while you're struggling with yours." I opened a new document. "Now tell me what you've learned."

For a moment, Ethan just looked at me. Then he shook his head slightly, smiling despite everything. "You're unbelievable."

"Is that a compliment?"

"The highest one I can give." He pulled the books back toward us. "Okay. Here's what I've found. Deferred students who get accepted in regular decision usually do three things: submit a strong letter of continued interest, provide meaningful updates on achievements or grades, and sometimes submit an additional letter of recommendation from someone who can speak to recent growth."

I started taking notes. "Letter of continued interest—basically an essay reaffirming your commitment to Princeton and explaining what you've done since applying?"

"Exactly. It needs to be specific, not generic enthusiasm. New information only, not just restating what was already in my application."

"Updates on achievements. You've got midterm grades—all As, right?"

"Yeah. Not that different from what they've already seen, but it shows consistency."

"What about the research paper? Professor Brennan said he'd help us submit to that journal. If we get it accepted for publication before regular decision results, that's a significant update."

Ethan's eyes lit up. "That's actually perfect. It demonstrates continued academic engagement and collaboration—exactly what Dr. Morrison said was missing from our original applications."

"So we prioritize getting that paper revised and submitted ASAP." I added it to my notes. "What else?"

"Additional recommendation letter. The problem is who to ask. My teachers already wrote for my early application."

"What about Dr. Morrison? She's seen your growth through the collaboration requirement. She could speak to how you've developed partnership skills and emotional intelligence."

"Do you think she would?"

"She mandated six weeks of study sessions because she thought we needed to learn collaboration. You proving she was right seems like exactly the kind of thing she'd want to support."

Ethan made a note. "I'll ask her today."

We spent the next hour going through his deferred application strategy point by point. I read drafts of his letter of continued interest, helping him strike the balance between enthusiastic and desperate. We outlined the timeline for the research paper submission. We identified three meaningful achievements from fall semester he could highlight.

At nine AM, Study Room 3B opened up. We moved our work there without discussion, settling into our usual spots at the table. The familiar space made everything feel more manageable.

"Read this paragraph," Ethan said, turning his laptop toward me. "Does it sound too desperate?"

I read: *"While my deferral was disappointing, it has given me the opportunity to reflect on why Princeton remains my first choice. The collaborative research I completed this fall reinforced my passion for interdisciplinary study, and Princeton's unique certificate programs would allow me to pursue both diplomatic history and public policy in ways unavailable at other institutions."*

"It's good," I said. "Specific without being desperate. But maybe add something about the academic culture? Something that shows you've really thought about fit beyond just programs."

"Like what?"

"Like... you're someone who does your best work in partnership. Princeton's emphasis on collaborative junior papers and senior theses creates an environment where that strength would thrive. You're not just looking for prestigious programs—you're looking for a place where intellectual community matters."

Ethan started typing, incorporating the feedback. "How do you do that?"

"Do what?"

"See exactly what's missing and know how to fix it."

"Practice. I've been editing my own essays obsessively for four years." I smiled. "Plus, I know you. I know what makes you different from other applicants."

He looked up from his typing. "And what's that?"

"You're genuinely collaborative in a field that usually rewards individual achievement. You make people around you better. You're honest about struggle in a culture that values appearing effortless. That's what Princeton needs to see—not just that you want to go there, but why you specifically would contribute something unique."

"I make people better?" Ethan's voice was quiet.

"You made me better. Less isolated, more willing to ask for help, more human." I held his gaze. "That's worth more than another perfect test score."

The moment stretched between us, loaded with things neither of us was quite ready to say.

"Thank you," Ethan said finally. "For this. For helping instead of just celebrating your own acceptance."

"We're in this together. That doesn't change just because Princeton made different decisions about us."

"So what happens if I don't get in during regular decision? If I end up at Yale and you're at Princeton?"

I thought about his Thanksgiving text researching train schedules. "Then we figure it out. An hour and a half isn't that far."

"You've researched the distance?"

"Maybe."

He smiled. "Hannah Price, planning logistics for a friendship."

"Or whatever this is," I said before I could stop myself.

The words hung in the air. Ethan's expression shifted into something I couldn't quite read.

"Whatever this is," he echoed softly.

My phone buzzed, breaking the moment. Sarah checking if I wanted lunch. I texted back a quick yes and looked up to find Ethan packing his materials.

"I should let you go," he said. "You've already given me your whole morning."

"I have time—"

"Hannah." He smiled. "Go have lunch with Sarah. Celebrate your acceptance, even if just a little. You earned it."

"Only if you promise we're still meeting tonight for our regular session."

"Seven PM, Study Room 3B. I'll bring the journal submission guidelines." He stood, slinging his bag over his shoulder. "And Hannah? Thank you. Really. Yesterday I thought deferral was the end. Today I actually believe I have a shot at regular decision. That's because of you."

I watched him leave, then sat alone in Study Room 3B for a moment. Twenty-four hours ago, I'd gotten into my dream school. It should have been the best day of my senior year.

Instead, the best part had been this morning—sitting with Ethan, helping him strategize, watching determination replace disappointment. Making him believe he had a shot.

Sarah was right. I was completely in love with him.

And somehow, that mattered more than Princeton.

That evening, Ethan arrived at Study Room 3B with the journal submission guidelines and actual optimism in his expression. We spent two hours revising our research paper, tightening arguments and polishing prose.

At nine PM, we packed up to leave. Walking across the quad, our breath forming clouds in the December cold, Ethan said, "I talked to Dr. Morrison this afternoon. About the recommendation letter."

"And?"

"She said yes. Said watching us go from rivals to genuine partners was one of the most rewarding experiences of her career as a counselor."

I smiled. "She's not wrong."

"She also said something else." Ethan stopped walking. We were under the oak tree, the same spot where he'd told me I belonged at Cambridge Prep. "She said some of the best things in life come from requirements we initially resist."

"Very Dr. Morrison."

"Hannah." He turned to face me fully. "These past few months—working with you, getting to know you—that's been the best part of Cambridge Prep. Better than chess club captain or perfect grades or any of it. I need you to know that."

My heart was pounding. "I know. It's been the best part for me too."

"Even though I probably cost you some study time? Made your life more complicated?"

"Especially because of that." I took a breath. "You made everything better, Ethan. Including me."

We stood there under the oak tree, close enough that I could see my breath mingling with his in the December night. Neither of us moved. Neither of us looked away.

"I should let you get back to Whitman," Ethan said finally, voice rough. "It's freezing out here."

"Yeah."

But neither of us moved.

"Tomorrow?" he asked. "Same time?"

"I wouldn't miss it."

We walked back to the dorms together, and when we reached the fork in the path, the goodbye felt weighted with all the things we still weren't saying.

But we were getting closer.

And that was enough.

For now.
